Some of the *.tex files need special versions of TeX to typeset them.
The files cs-*.tex and sk-*.tex need csTeX, a special version of TeX
tailored to typesetting Czech and Slovak documents.  We provide
generated files for these documents, so that you could print them
without installing the modified TeX versions.
