1.1 Summary
===========

Org is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, and doing
project planning with a fast and effective plain-text system.

   Org develops organizational tasks around NOTES files that contain
lists or information about projects as plain text.  Org is implemented
on top of Outline mode, which makes it possible to keep the content of
large files well structured.  Visibility cycling and structure editing
help to work with the tree.  Tables are easily created with a built-in
table editor.  Org supports TODO items, deadlines, timestamps, and
scheduling.  It dynamically compiles entries into an agenda that
utilizes and smoothly integrates much of the Emacs calendar and diary.
Plain text URL-like links connect to websites, emails, Usenet messages,
BBDB entries, and any files related to the projects.  For printing and
sharing of notes, an Org file can be exported as a structured ASCII
file, as HTML, or (TODO and agenda items only) as an iCalendar file.
It can also serve as a publishing tool for a set of linked web pages.

   An important design aspect that distinguishes Org from, for example,
Planner/Muse is that it encourages you to store every piece of
information only once.  In Planner, you have project pages, day pages
and possibly other files, duplicating some information such as tasks.
In Org, you only have notes files.  In your notes you mark entries as
tasks, and label them with tags and timestamps.  All necessary lists,
like a schedule for the day, the agenda for a meeting, tasks lists
selected by tags, etc., are created dynamically when you need them.

   Org keeps simple things simple.  When first fired up, it should feel
like a straightforward, easy to use outliner.  Complexity is not
imposed, but a large amount of functionality is available when you need
it.  Org is a toolbox and can be used in different ways, for example as:

     * an outline extension with visibility cycling and structure editing
     * an ASCII system and table editor for taking structured notes
     * an ASCII table editor with spreadsheet-like capabilities
     * a TODO list editor
     * a full agenda and planner with deadlines and work scheduling
     * an environment to implement David Allen's GTD system
     * a basic database application
     * a simple hypertext system, with HTML and LaTeX export
     * a publishing tool to create a set of interlinked webpages

   Org's automatic, context-sensitive table editor with spreadsheet
capabilities can be integrated into any major mode by activating the
minor Orgtbl mode.  Using a translation step, it can be used to maintain
tables in arbitrary file types, for example in LaTeX.  The structure
editing and list creation capabilities can be used outside Org with the
minor Orgstruct mode.

   There is a website for Org which provides links to the newest
version of Org, as well as additional information, frequently asked
questions (FAQ), links to tutorials, etc.  This page is located at
`http://orgmode.org'.


File: org,  Node: Installation,  Next: Activation,  Prev: Summary,  Up: Introduction

1.2 Installation
================

Important: If you are using a version of Org that is part of the Emacs
distribution or an XEmacs package, please skip this section and go
directly to *note Activation::.

   If you have downloaded Org from the Web, either as a distribution
`.zip' or `.tar' file, or as a Git archive, you must take the following
steps to install it: go into the unpacked Org distribution directory
and edit the top section of the file `Makefile'.  You must set the name
of the Emacs binary (likely either `emacs' or `xemacs'), and the paths
to the directories where local Lisp and Info files are kept.  If you
don't have access to the system-wide directories, you can simply run
Org directly from the distribution directory by adding the `lisp'
subdirectory to the Emacs load path.  To do this, add the following
line to `.emacs':

     (setq load-path (cons "~/path/to/orgdir/lisp" load-path))

If you plan to use code from the `contrib' subdirectory, do a similar
step for this directory:

     (setq load-path (cons "~/path/to/orgdir/contrib/lisp" load-path))



   XEmacs users now need to install the file `noutline.el' from the
`xemacs' sub-directory of the Org distribution.  Use the command:

          make install-noutline



Now byte-compile the Lisp files with the shell command:

     make

If you are running Org from the distribution directory, this is all.
If you want to install Org into the system directories, use (as
administrator)

     make install

   Installing Info files is system dependent, because of differences in
the `install-info' program.  In Debian it copies the info files into the
correct directory and modifies the info directory file.  In many other
systems, the files need to be copied to the correct directory
separately, and `install-info' then only modifies the directory file.
Check your system documentation to find out which of the following
commands you need:

     make install-info
     make install-info-debian

   Then add the following line to `.emacs'.  It is needed so that Emacs
can autoload functions that are located in files not immediately loaded
when Org-mode starts.
     (require 'org-install)

   Do not forget to activate Org as described in the following section.


File: org,  Node: Activation,  Next: Feedback,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Introduction

1.3 Activation
==============

Add the following lines to your `.emacs' file.  The last three lines
define _global_ keys for the commands `org-store-link', `org-agenda',
and `org-iswitchb'--please choose suitable keys yourself.

     ;; The following lines are always needed.  Choose your own keys.
     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.org\\'" . org-mode))
     (global-set-key "\C-cl" 'org-store-link)
     (global-set-key "\C-ca" 'org-agenda)
     (global-set-key "\C-cb" 'org-iswitchb)

   Furthermore, you must activate `font-lock-mode' in Org buffers,
because significant functionality depends on font-locking being active.
You can do this with either one of the following two lines (XEmacs
users must use the second option):
     (global-font-lock-mode 1)                     ; for all buffers
     (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock)  ; Org buffers only

   With this setup, all files with extension `.org' will be put into
Org mode.  As an alternative, make the first line of a file look like
this:

     MY PROJECTS    -*- mode: org; -*-

which will select Org mode for this buffer no matter what the file's
name is.  See also the variable `org-insert-mode-line-in-empty-file'.

   Many commands in Org work on the region if the region is active.  To
make use of this, you need to have `transient-mark-mode'
(`zmacs-regions' in XEmacs) turned on.  In Emacs 23 this is the default,
in Emacs 22 you need to do this yourself with
     (transient-mark-mode 1)
   If you do not like `transient-mark-mode', you can create an active
region by using the mouse to select a region, or pressing `C-<SPC>'
twice before moving the cursor.

1.4 Feedback
============

If you find problems with Org, or if you have questions, remarks, or
ideas about it, please mail to the Org mailing list
<emacs-orgmode@gnu.org>.  If you are not a member of the mailing list,
your mail will be passed to the list after a moderator has approved it.

   For bug reports, please provide as much information as possible,
including the version information of Emacs (`M-x emacs-version <RET>')
and Org (`M-x org-version <RET>'), as well as the Org related setup in
`.emacs'.  The easiest way to do this is to use the command
     M-x org-submit-bug-report
   which will put all this information into an Emacs mail buffer so
that you only need to add your description.  If you re not sending the
Email from within Emacs, please copy and paste the content into your
Email program.

   If an error occurs, a backtrace can be very useful (see below on how
to create one).  Often a small example file helps, along with clear
information about:

  1. What exactly did you do?

  2. What did you expect to happen?

  3. What happened instead?
        Thank you for helping to improve this mode.

How to create a useful backtrace
................................

If working with Org produces an error with a message you don't
understand, you may have hit a bug.  The best way to report this is by
providing, in addition to what was mentioned above, a _backtrace_.
This is information from the built-in debugger about where and how the
error occurred.  Here is how to produce a useful backtrace:

  1. Reload uncompiled versions of all Org-mode Lisp files.  The
     backtrace contains much more information if it is produced with
     uncompiled code.  To do this, use
          C-u M-x org-reload RET
     or select `Org -> Refresh/Reload -> Reload Org uncompiled' from the
     menu.

  2. Go to the `Options' menu and select `Enter Debugger on Error'
     (XEmacs has this option in the `Troubleshooting' sub-menu).

  3. Do whatever you have to do to hit the error.  Don't forget to
     document the steps you take.

  4. When you hit the error, a `*Backtrace*' buffer will appear on the
     screen.  Save this buffer to a file (for example using `C-x C-w')
     and attach it to your bug report.

1.5 Typesetting conventions used in this manual
===============================================

Org uses three types of keywords: TODO keywords, tags, and property
names.  In this manual we use the following conventions:

`TODO'
`WAITING'
     TODO keywords are written with all capitals, even if they are
     user-defined.

`boss'
`ARCHIVE'
     User-defined tags are written in lowercase; built-in tags with
     special meaning are written with all capitals.

`Release'
`PRIORITY'
     User-defined properties are capitalized; built-in properties with
     special meaning are written with all capitals.

2.1 Outlines
============

Org is implemented on top of Outline mode.  Outlines allow a document
to be organized in a hierarchical structure, which (at least for me) is
the best representation of notes and thoughts.  An overview of this
structure is achieved by folding (hiding) large parts of the document
to show only the general document structure and the parts currently
being worked on.  Org greatly simplifies the use of outlines by
compressing the entire show/hide functionality into a single command,
`org-cycle', which is bound to the <TAB> key.


File: org,  Node: Headlines,  Next: Visibility cycling,  Prev: Outlines,  Up: Document Structure

2.2 Headlines
=============

Headlines define the structure of an outline tree.  The headlines in
Org start with one or more stars, on the left margin(1).  For example:

     * Top level headline
     ** Second level
     *** 3rd level
         some text
     *** 3rd level
         more text

     * Another top level headline

Some people find the many stars too noisy and would prefer an outline
that has whitespace followed by a single star as headline starters.
*note Clean view::, describes a setup to realize this.

   An empty line after the end of a subtree is considered part of it and
will be hidden when the subtree is folded.  However, if you leave at
least two empty lines, one empty line will remain visible after folding
the subtree, in order to structure the collapsed view.  See the
variable `org-cycle-separator-lines' to modify this behavior.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) See the variable `org-special-ctrl-a/e' to configure special
behavior of `C-a' and `C-e' in headlines.


File: org,  Node: Visibility cycling,  Next: Motion,  Prev: Headlines,  Up: Document Structure

2.3 Visibility cycling
======================

Outlines make it possible to hide parts of the text in the buffer.  Org
uses just two commands, bound to <TAB> and `S-<TAB>' to change the
visibility in the buffer.

`<TAB>'
     _Subtree cycling_: Rotate current subtree among the states

          ,-> FOLDED -> CHILDREN -> SUBTREE --.
          '-----------------------------------'

     The cursor must be on a headline for this to work(1).  When the
     cursor is at the beginning of the buffer and the first line is not
     a headline, then <TAB> actually runs global cycling (see
     below)(2).  Also when called with a prefix argument (`C-u <TAB>'),
     global cycling is invoked.

`S-<TAB>'
`C-u <TAB>'
     _Global cycling_: Rotate the entire buffer among the states

          ,-> OVERVIEW -> CONTENTS -> SHOW ALL --.
          '--------------------------------------'

     When `S-<TAB>' is called with a numeric prefix argument N, the
     CONTENTS view up to headlines of level N will be shown.  Note that
     inside tables, `S-<TAB>' jumps to the previous field.

`C-u C-u C-u <TAB>'
     Show all, including drawers.  

`C-c C-r'
     Reveal context around point, showing the current entry, the
     following heading and the hierarchy above.  Useful for working
     near a location that has been exposed by a sparse tree command
     (*note Sparse trees::) or an agenda command (*note Agenda
     commands::).  With a prefix argument show, on each level, all
     sibling headings.  

`C-c C-x b'
     Show the current subtree in an indirect buffer(3).  With a numeric
     prefix argument N, go up to level N and then take that tree.  If N
     is negative then go up that many levels.  With a `C-u' prefix, do
     not remove the previously used indirect buffer.

   When Emacs first visits an Org file, the global state is set to
OVERVIEW, i.e. only the top level headlines are visible.  This can be
configured through the variable `org-startup-folded', or on a per-file
basis by adding one of the following lines anywhere in the buffer:

     #+STARTUP: overview
     #+STARTUP: content
     #+STARTUP: showall
     #+STARTUP: showeverything

Furthermore, any entries with a `VISIBILITY' property (*note Properties
and Columns::) will get their visibility adapted accordingly.  Allowed
values for this property are `folded', `children', `content', and `all'.
`C-u C-u <TAB>'
     Switch back to the startup visibility of the buffer, i.e. whatever
     is requested by startup options and `VISIBILITY' properties in
     individual entries.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) see, however, the option `org-cycle-emulate-tab'.

   (2) see the option `org-cycle-global-at-bob'.

   (3) The indirect buffer (*note Indirect Buffers: (emacs)Indirect
Buffers.)  will contain the entire buffer, but will be narrowed to the
current tree.  Editing the indirect buffer will also change the
original buffer, but without affecting visibility in that buffer.


File: org,  Node: Motion,  Next: Structure editing,  Prev: Visibility cycling,  Up: Document Structure

2.4 Motion
==========

The following commands jump to other headlines in the buffer.

`C-c C-n'
     Next heading.  

`C-c C-p'
     Previous heading.  

`C-c C-f'
     Next heading same level.  

`C-c C-b'
     Previous heading same level.  

`C-c C-u'
     Backward to higher level heading.  

`C-c C-j'
     Jump to a different place without changing the current outline
     visibility.  Shows the document structure in a temporary buffer,
     where you can use the following keys to find your destination: 
          <TAB>         Cycle visibility.
          <down> / <up>   Next/previous visible headline.
          <RET>         Select this location.
          /           Do a Sparse-tree search
          The following keys work if you turn off `org-goto-auto-isearch'
          n / p        Next/previous visible headline.
          f / b        Next/previous headline same level.
          u            One level up.
          0-9          Digit argument.
          q            Quit
     See also the variable `org-goto-interface'.


File: org,  Node: Structure editing,  Next: Sparse trees,  Prev: Motion,  Up: Document Structure

2.5 Structure editing
=====================

`M-<RET>'
     Insert new heading with same level as current.  If the cursor is
     in a plain list item, a new item is created (*note Plain lists::).
     To force creation of a new headline, use a prefix argument, or
     first press <RET> to get to the beginning of the next line.  When
     this command is used in the middle of a line, the line is split
     and the rest of the line becomes the new headline(1).  If the
     command is used at the beginning of a headline, the new headline is
     created before the current line.  If at the beginning of any other
     line, the content of that line is made the new heading.  If the
     command is used at the end of a folded subtree (i.e. behind the
     ellipses at the end of a headline), then a headline like the
     current one will be inserted after the end of the subtree.  

`C-<RET>'
     Just like `M-<RET>', except when adding a new heading below the
     current heading, the new heading is placed after the body instead
     of before it.  This command works from anywhere in the entry.  

`M-S-<RET>'
     Insert new TODO entry with same level as current heading.  See
     also the variable `org-treat-insert-todo-heading-as-state-change'.  

`C-S-<RET>'
     Insert new TODO entry with same level as current heading.  Like
     `C-<RET>', the new headline will be inserted after the current
     subtree.  

`<TAB> in new, empty entry'
     In a new entry with no text yet, the first <TAB> demotes the entry
     to become a child of the previous one.  The next <TAB> makes it a
     parent, and so on, all the way to top level.  Yet another <TAB>,
     and you are back to the initial level.  

`M-<left>'
     Promote current heading by one level.  

`M-<right>'
     Demote current heading by one level.  

`M-S-<left>'
     Promote the current subtree by one level.  

`M-S-<right>'
     Demote the current subtree by one level.  

`M-S-<up>'
     Move subtree up (swap with previous subtree of same level).  

`M-S-<down>'
     Move subtree down (swap with next subtree of same level).  

`C-c C-x C-w'
     Kill subtree, i.e. remove it from buffer but save in kill ring.
     With a numeric prefix argument N, kill N sequential subtrees.  

`C-c C-x M-w'
     Copy subtree to kill ring.  With a numeric prefix argument N, copy
     the N sequential subtrees.  

`C-c C-x C-y'
     Yank subtree from kill ring.  This does modify the level of the
     subtree to make sure the tree fits in nicely at the yank position.
     The yank level can also be specified with a numeric prefix
     argument, or by yanking after a headline marker like `****'.  

`C-y'
     Depending on the variables `org-yank-adjusted-subtrees' and
     `org-yank-folded-subtrees', Org's internal `yank' command will
     paste subtrees folded and in a clever way, using the same command
     as `C-c C-x C-y'.  With the default settings, no level adjustment
     will take place, but the yanked tree will be folded unless doing
     so would swallow text previously visible.  Any prefix argument to
     this command will force a normal `yank' to be executed, with the
     prefix passed along.  A good way to force a normal yank is `C-u
     C-y'.  If you use `yank-pop' after a yank, it will yank previous
     kill items plainly, without adjustment and folding.  

`C-c C-x c'
     Clone a subtree by making a number of sibling copies of it.  You
     will be prompted for the number of copies to make, and you can
     also specify if any timestamps in the entry should be shifted.
     This can be useful, for example, to create a number of tasks
     related to a series of lectures to prepare.  For more details, see
     the docstring of the command `org-clone-subtree-with-time-shift'.  

`C-c C-w'
     Refile entry or region to a different location.  *Note Refiling
     notes::.  

`C-c ^'
     Sort same-level entries.  When there is an active region, all
     entries in the region will be sorted.  Otherwise the children of
     the current headline are sorted.  The command prompts for the
     sorting method, which can be alphabetically, numerically, by time
     (first timestamp with active preferred, creation time, scheduled
     time, deadline time), by priority, by TODO keyword (in the
     sequence the keywords have been defined in the setup) or by the
     value of a property.  Reverse sorting is possible as well.  You
     can also supply your own function to extract the sorting key.
     With a `C-u' prefix, sorting will be case-sensitive.  With two
     `C-u C-u' prefixes, duplicate entries will also be removed.  

`C-x n s'
     Narrow buffer to current subtree.  

`C-x n w'
     Widen buffer to remove narrowing.  

`C-c *'
     Turn a normal line or plain list item into a headline (so that it
     becomes a subheading at its location).  Also turn a headline into
     a normal line by removing the stars.  If there is an active
     region, turn all lines in the region into headlines.  If the first
     line in the region was an item, turn only the item lines into
     headlines.  Finally, if the first line is a headline, remove the
     stars from all headlines in the region.

   When there is an active region (Transient Mark mode), promotion and
demotion work on all headlines in the region.  To select a region of
headlines, it is best to place both point and mark at the beginning of a
line, mark at the beginning of the first headline, and point at the line
just after the last headline to change.  Note that when the cursor is
inside a table (*note Tables::), the Meta-Cursor keys have different
functionality.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If you do not want the line to be split, customize the variable
`org-M-RET-may-split-line'.


File: org,  Node: Sparse trees,  Next: Plain lists,  Prev: Structure editing,  Up: Document Structure

2.6 Sparse trees
================

An important feature of Org mode is the ability to construct _sparse
trees_ for selected information in an outline tree, so that the entire
document is folded as much as possible, but the selected information is
made visible along with the headline structure above it(1).  Just try
it out and you will see immediately how it works.

   Org mode contains several commands creating such trees, all these
commands can be accessed through a dispatcher:

`C-c /'
     This prompts for an extra key to select a sparse-tree creating
     command.  

`C-c / r'
     Occur.  Prompts for a regexp and shows a sparse tree with all
     matches.  If the match is in a headline, the headline is made
     visible.  If the match is in the body of an entry, headline and
     body are made visible.  In order to provide minimal context, also
     the full hierarchy of headlines above the match is shown, as well
     as the headline following the match.  Each match is also
     highlighted; the highlights disappear when the buffer is changed
     by an editing command(2), or by pressing `C-c C-c'.  When called
     with a `C-u' prefix argument, previous highlights are kept, so
     several calls to this command can be stacked.

For frequently used sparse trees of specific search strings, you can
use the variable `org-agenda-custom-commands' to define fast keyboard
access to specific sparse trees.  These commands will then be
accessible through the agenda dispatcher (*note Agenda dispatcher::).
For example:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("f" occur-tree "FIXME")))

will define the key `C-c a f' as a shortcut for creating a sparse tree
matching the string `FIXME'.

   The other sparse tree commands select headings based on TODO
keywords, tags, or properties and will be discussed later in this
manual.

   To print a sparse tree, you can use the Emacs command
`ps-print-buffer-with-faces' which does not print invisible parts of
the document (3).  Or you can use the command `C-c C-e v' to export
only the visible part of the document and print the resulting file.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) See also the variables `org-show-hierarchy-above',
`org-show-following-heading', `org-show-siblings', and
`org-show-entry-below' for detailed control on how much context is
shown around each match.

   (2) This depends on the option `org-remove-highlights-with-change'

   (3) This does not work under XEmacs, because XEmacs uses selective
display for outlining, not text properties.


File: org,  Node: Plain lists,  Next: Drawers,  Prev: Sparse trees,  Up: Document Structure

2.7 Plain lists
===============

Within an entry of the outline tree, hand-formatted lists can provide
additional structure.  They also provide a way to create lists of
checkboxes (*note Checkboxes::).  Org supports editing such lists, and
the HTML exporter (*note Exporting::) parses and formats them.

   Org knows ordered lists, unordered lists, and description lists.
   * _Unordered_ list items start with `-', `+', or `*'(1) as bullets.

   * _Ordered_ list items start with a numeral followed by either a
     period or a right parenthesis, such as `1.' or `1)'.

   * _Description_ list items are unordered list items, and contain the
     separator ` :: ' to separate the description _term_ from the
     description.

   Items belonging to the same list must have the same indentation on
the first line.  In particular, if an ordered list reaches number
`10.', then the 2-digit numbers must be written left-aligned with the
other numbers in the list.  Indentation also determines the end of a
list item.  It ends before the next line that is indented like the
bullet/number, or less.  Empty lines are part of the previous item, so
you can have several paragraphs in one item.  If you would like an
empty line to terminate all currently open plain lists, configure the
variable `org-empty-line-terminates-plain-lists'.  Here is an example:

     ** Lord of the Rings
        My favorite scenes are (in this order)
        1. The attack of the Rohirrim
        2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king
           + this was already my favorite scene in the book
           + I really like Miranda Otto.
        3. Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas
            - on DVD only
           He makes a really funny face when it happens.
        But in the end, no individual scenes matter but the film as a whole.
        Important actors in this film are:
        - Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo
        - Sean Austin :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.  I still remember
          him very well from his role as Mikey Walsh in The Goonies.

   Org supports these lists by tuning filling and wrapping commands to
deal with them correctly(2), and by exporting them properly (*note
Exporting::).  Since indentation is what governs the structure of these
lists, many structural constructs like `#+BEGIN_...' blocks can be
indented to signal that they should be part of a list item.

   The following commands act on items when the cursor is in the first
line of an item (the line with the bullet or number).

`<TAB>'
     Items can be folded just like headline levels.  Normally this
     works only if the cursor is on a plain list item.  For more
     details, see the variable `org-cycle-include-plain-lists'. to
     `integrate', plain list items will be treated like low-level.  The
     level of an item is then given by the indentation of the
     bullet/number.  Items are always subordinate to real headlines,
     however; the hierarchies remain completely separated.

     If `org-cycle-include-plain-lists' has not been set, <TAB> fixes
     the indentation of the current line in a heuristic way.  

`M-<RET>'
     Insert new item at current level.  With a prefix argument, force a
     new heading (*note Structure editing::).  If this command is used
     in the middle of a line, the line is _split_ and the rest of the
     line becomes the new item(3).  If this command is executed in the
     _whitespace before a bullet or number_, the new item is created
     _before_ the current item.  If the command is executed in the white
     space before the text that is part of an item but does not contain
     the bullet, a bullet is added to the current line.  

`M-S-<RET>'
     Insert a new item with a checkbox (*note Checkboxes::).  

`<TAB> in new, empty item'
     In a new item with no text yet, the first <TAB> demotes the item to
     become a child of the previous one.  The next <TAB> makes it a
     parent, and so on, all the way to the left margin.  Yet another
     <TAB>, and you are back to the initial level.  

`S-<up>'
`S-<down>'
     Jump to the previous/next item in the current list, but only if
     `org-support-shift-select' is off.  If not, you can still use
     paragraph jumping commands like `C-<up>' and `C-<down>' to quite
     similar effect.  

`M-S-<up>'
`M-S-<down>'
     Move the item including subitems up/down (swap with previous/next
     item of same indentation).  If the list is ordered, renumbering is
     automatic.  

`M-S-<left>'
`M-S-<right>'
     Decrease/increase the indentation of the item, including subitems.
     Initially, the item tree is selected based on current indentation.
     When these commands are executed several times in direct
     succession, the initially selected region is used, even if the new
     indentation would imply a different hierarchy.  To use the new
     hierarchy, break the command chain with a cursor motion or so.  

`C-c C-c'
     If there is a checkbox (*note Checkboxes::) in the item line,
     toggle the state of the checkbox.  If not, this command makes sure
     that all the items on this list level use the same bullet.
     Furthermore, if this is an ordered list, make sure the numbering
     is OK.  

`C-c -'
     Cycle the entire list level through the different
     itemize/enumerate bullets (`-', `+', `*', `1.', `1)').  With a
     numeric prefix argument N, select the Nth bullet from this list.
     If there is an active region when calling this, all lines will be
     converted to list items.  If the first line already was a list
     item, any item markers will be removed from the list.  Finally,
     even without an active region, a normal line will be converted
     into a list item.  

`C-c *'
     Turn a plain list item into a headline (so that it becomes a
     subheading at its location). *Note Structure editing::, for a
     detailed explanation.  

`S-<left>/<right>'
     This command also cycles bullet styles when the cursor in on the
     bullet or anywhere in an item line, details depending on
     `org-support-shift-select'.  

`C-c ^'
     Sort the plain list.  You will be prompted for the sorting method:
     numerically, alphabetically, by time, or by custom function.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) When using `*' as a bullet, lines must be indented or they will
be seen as top-level headlines.  Also, when you are hiding leading
stars to get a clean outline view, plain list items starting with a
star are visually indistinguishable from true headlines.  In short:
even though `*' is supported, it may be better to not use it for plain
list items.

   (2) Org only changes the filling settings for Emacs.  For XEmacs,
you should use Kyle E. Jones' `filladapt.el'.  To turn this on, put
into `.emacs': `(require 'filladapt)'

   (3) If you do not want the line to be split, customize the variable
`org-M-RET-may-split-line'.

2.8 Drawers
===========

Sometimes you want to keep information associated with an entry, but you
normally don't want to see it.  For this, Org mode has _drawers_.
Drawers need to be configured with the variable `org-drawers'(1).
Drawers look like this:

     ** This is a headline
        Still outside the drawer
        :DRAWERNAME:
           This is inside the drawer.
        :END:
        After the drawer.

   Visibility cycling (*note Visibility cycling::) on the headline will
hide and show the entry, but keep the drawer collapsed to a single
line.  In order to look inside the drawer, you need to move the cursor
to the drawer line and press <TAB> there.  Org mode uses the
`PROPERTIES' drawer for storing properties (*note Properties and
Columns::), and you can also arrange for state change notes (*note
Tracking TODO state changes::) and clock times (*note Clocking work
time::) to be stored in a drawer `LOGBOOK'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) You can define drawers on a per-file basis with a line like
`#+DRAWERS: HIDDEN PROPERTIES STATE'

2.9 Blocks
==========

Org-mode uses begin...end blocks for various purposes from including
source code examples (*note Literal examples::) to capturing time
logging information (*note Clocking work time::).  These blocks can be
folded and unfolded by pressing TAB in the begin line.  You can also
get all blocks folded at startup by configuring the variable
`org-hide-block-startup' or on a per-file basis by using

     #+STARTUP: hideblocks
     #+STARTUP: nohideblocks

2.10 Footnotes
==============

Org mode supports the creation of footnotes.  In contrast to the
`footnote.el' package, Org mode's footnotes are designed for work on a
larger document, not only for one-off documents like emails.  The basic
syntax is similar to the one used by `footnote.el', i.e. a footnote is
defined in a paragraph that is started by a footnote marker in square
brackets in column 0, no indentation allowed.  If you need a paragraph
break inside a footnote, use the LaTeX idiom `\par'.  The footnote
reference is simply the marker in square brackets, inside text.  For
example:

     The Org homepage[fn:1] now looks a lot better than it used to.
     ...
     [fn:1] The link is: http://orgmode.org

   Org mode extends the number-based syntax to _named_ footnotes and
optional inline definition.  Using plain numbers as markers (as
`footnote.el' does) is supported for backward compatibility, but not
encouraged because of possible conflicts with LaTeX snippets (*note
Embedded LaTeX::).  Here are the valid references:

`[1]'
     A plain numeric footnote marker.  Compatible with `footnote.el',
     but not recommended because somthing like `[1]' could easily be
     part of a code snippet.

`[fn:name]'
     A named footnote reference, where `name' is a unique label word,
     or, for simplicity of automatic creation, a number.

`[fn:: This is the inline definition of this footnote]'
     A LaTeX-like anonymous footnote where the definition is given
     directly at the reference point.

`[fn:name: a definition]'
     An inline definition of a footnote, which also specifies a name
     for the note.  Since Org allows multiple references to the same
     note, you can then use `[fn:name]' to create additional references.

   Footnote labels can be created automatically, or you can create
names yourself.  This is handled by the variable
`org-footnote-auto-label' and its corresponding `#+STARTUP' keywords,
see the docstring of that variable for details.

The following command handles footnotes:

`C-c C-x f'
     The footnote action command.

     When the cursor is on a footnote reference, jump to the
     definition.  When it is at a definition, jump to the (first)
     reference.

     Otherwise, create a new footnote.  Depending on the variable
     `org-footnote-define-inline'(1), the definition will be placed
     right into the text as part of the reference, or separately into
     the location determined by the variable `org-footnote-section'.

     When this command is called with a prefix argument, a menu of
     additional options is offered:
          s   Sort the footnote definitions by reference sequence.  During editing,
              Org makes no effort to sort footnote definitions into a particular
              sequence.  If you want them sorted, use this command, which will
              also move entries according to `org-footnote-section'.  Automatic
              sorting after each insertion/deletion can be configured using the
              variable `org-footnote-auto-adjust'.
          r   Renumber the simple `fn:N' footnotes.  Automatic renumbering
              after each insertion/deletion can be configured using the variable
              `org-footnote-auto-adjust'.
          S   Short for first `r', then `s' action.
          n   Normalize the footnotes by collecting all definitions (including
              inline definitions) into a special section, and then numbering them
              in sequence.  The references will then also be numbers.  This is
              meant to be the final step before finishing a document (e.g. sending
              off an email).  The exporters do this automatically, and so could
              something like `message-send-hook'.
          d   Delete the footnote at point, and all definitions of and references
              to it.
     Depending on the variable `org-footnote-auto-adjust'(2),
     renumbering and sorting footnotes can be automatic after each
     insertion or deletion.

`C-c C-c'
     If the cursor is on a footnote reference, jump to the definition.
     If it is a the definition, jump back to the reference.  When
     called at a footnote location with a prefix argument, offer the
     same menu as `C-c C-x f'.  

`C-c C-o  or mouse-1/2'
     Footnote labels are also links to the corresponding
     definition/reference, and you can use the usual commands to follow
     these links.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The corresponding in-buffer setting is: `#+STARTUP: fninline' or
`#+STARTUP: nofninline'

   (2) the corresponding in-buffer options are `fnadjust' and
`nofnadjust'.

2.11 The Orgstruct minor mode
=============================

If you like the intuitive way the Org mode structure editing and list
formatting works, you might want to use these commands in other modes
like Text mode or Mail mode as well.  The minor mode `orgstruct-mode'
makes this possible.   Toggle the mode with `M-x orgstruct-mode', or
turn it on by default, for example in Mail mode, with one of:

     (add-hook 'mail-mode-hook 'turn-on-orgstruct)
     (add-hook 'mail-mode-hook 'turn-on-orgstruct++)

   When this mode is active and the cursor is on a line that looks to
Org like a headline or the first line of a list item, most structure
editing commands will work, even if the same keys normally have
different functionality in the major mode you are using.  If the cursor
is not in one of those special lines, Orgstruct mode lurks silently in
the shadow.  When you use `orgstruct++-mode', Org will also export
indentation and autofill settings into that mode, and detect item
context after the first line of an item.

File: org,  Node: Built-in table editor,  Next: Column width and alignment,  Prev: Tables,  Up: Tables

3.1 The built-in table editor
=============================

Org makes it easy to format tables in plain ASCII.  Any line with `|'
as the first non-whitespace character is considered part of a table.
`|' is also the column separator.  A table might look like this:

     | Name  | Phone | Age |
     |-------+-------+-----|
     | Peter |  1234 |  17 |
     | Anna  |  4321 |  25 |

   A table is re-aligned automatically each time you press <TAB> or
<RET> or `C-c C-c' inside the table.  <TAB> also moves to the next
field (<RET> to the next row) and creates new table rows at the end of
the table or before horizontal lines.  The indentation of the table is
set by the first line.  Any line starting with `|-' is considered as a
horizontal separator line and will be expanded on the next re-align to
span the whole table width.  So, to create the above table, you would
only type

     |Name|Phone|Age|
     |-

and then press <TAB> to align the table and start filling in fields.
Even faster would be to type `|Name|Phone|Age' followed by `C-c <RET>'.

   When typing text into a field, Org treats <DEL>, <Backspace>, and
all character keys in a special way, so that inserting and deleting
avoids shifting other fields.  Also, when typing _immediately after the
cursor was moved into a new field with `<TAB>', `S-<TAB>' or `<RET>'_,
the field is automatically made blank.  If this behavior is too
unpredictable for you, configure the variables
`org-enable-table-editor' and `org-table-auto-blank-field'.

Creation and conversion
.......................

`C-c |'
     Convert the active region to table. If every line contains at
     least one TAB character, the function assumes that the material is
     tab separated.  If every line contains a comma, comma-separated
     values (CSV) are assumed.  If not, lines are split at whitespace
     into fields.  You can use a prefix argument to force a specific
     separator: `C-u' forces CSV, `C-u C-u' forces TAB, and a numeric
     argument N indicates that at least N consecutive spaces, or
     alternatively a TAB will be the separator.
     If there is no active region, this command creates an empty Org
     table.  But it's easier just to start typing, like
     `|Name|Phone|Age <RET> |- <TAB>'.

Re-aligning and field motion
............................

`C-c C-c'
     Re-align the table without moving the cursor.  

`<TAB>'
     Re-align the table, move to the next field.  Creates a new row if
     necessary.  

`S-<TAB>'
     Re-align, move to previous field.  

`<RET>'
     Re-align the table and move down to next row.  Creates a new row if
     necessary.  At the beginning or end of a line, <RET> still does
     NEWLINE, so it can be used to split a table.  

`M-a'
     Move to beginning of the current table field, or on to the
     previous field.  

`M-e'
     Move to end of the current table field, or on to the next field.

Column and row editing
......................

`M-<left>'
`M-<right>'
     Move the current column left/right.  

`M-S-<left>'
     Kill the current column.  

`M-S-<right>'
     Insert a new column to the left of the cursor position.  

`M-<up>'
`M-<down>'
     Move the current row up/down.  

`M-S-<up>'
     Kill the current row or horizontal line.  

`M-S-<down>'
     Insert a new row above the current row.  With a prefix argument,
     the line is created below the current one.  

`C-c -'
     Insert a horizontal line below current row.  With a prefix
     argument, the line is created above the current line.  

`C-c <RET>'
     Insert a horizontal line below current row, and move the cursor
     into the row below that line.  

`C-c ^'
     Sort the table lines in the region.  The position of point
     indicates the column to be used for sorting, and the range of
     lines is the range between the nearest horizontal separator lines,
     or the entire table.  If point is before the first column, you
     will be prompted for the sorting column.  If there is an active
     region, the mark specifies the first line and the sorting column,
     while point should be in the last line to be included into the
     sorting.  The command prompts for the sorting type
     (alphabetically, numerically, or by time).  When called with a
     prefix argument, alphabetic sorting will be case-sensitive.

Regions
.......

`C-c C-x M-w'
     Copy a rectangular region from a table to a special clipboard.
     Point and mark determine edge fields of the rectangle.  If there
     is no active region, copy just the current field.  The process
     ignores horizontal separator lines.  

`C-c C-x C-w'
     Copy a rectangular region from a table to a special clipboard, and
     blank all fields in the rectangle.  So this is the "cut" operation.  

`C-c C-x C-y'
     Paste a rectangular region into a table.  The upper left corner
     ends up in the current field.  All involved fields will be
     overwritten.  If the rectangle does not fit into the present table,
     the table is enlarged as needed.  The process ignores horizontal
     separator lines.  

`M-RET'
     Wrap several fields in a column like a paragraph.  If there is an
     active region, and both point and mark are in the same column, the
     text in the column is wrapped to minimum width for the given
     number of lines.  A numeric prefix argument may be used to change
     the number of desired lines.  If there is no region, the current
     field is split at the cursor position and the text fragment to the
     right of the cursor is prepended to the field one line down. If
     there is no region, but you specify a prefix argument, the current
     field is made blank, and the content is appended to the field
     above.

Calculations
............

`C-c +'
     Sum the numbers in the current column, or in the rectangle defined
     by the active region.  The result is shown in the echo area and can
     be inserted with `C-y'.  

`S-<RET>'
     When current field is empty, copy from first non-empty field
     above.  When not empty, copy current field down to next row and
     move cursor along with it.  Depending on the variable
     `org-table-copy-increment', integer field values will be
     incremented during copy.  Integers that are too large will not be
     incremented.  Also, a `0' prefix argument temporarily disables the
     increment.  This key is also used by shift-selection and related
     modes (*note Conflicts::).

Miscellaneous
.............

`C-c `'
     Edit the current field in a separate window.  This is useful for
     fields that are not fully visible (*note Column width and
     alignment::).  When called with a `C-u' prefix, just make the full
     field visible, so that it can be edited in place.

`M-x org-table-import'
     Import a file as a table.  The table should be TAB or whitespace
     separated.  Use, for example, to import a spreadsheet table or data
     from a database, because these programs generally can write
     TAB-separated text files.  This command works by inserting the
     file into the buffer and then converting the region to a table.
     Any prefix argument is passed on to the converter, which uses it
     to determine the separator.

`C-c |'
     Tables can also be imported by pasting tabular text into the Org
     buffer, selecting the pasted text with `C-x C-x' and then using the
     `C-c |' command (see above under Creation and conversion).

`M-x org-table-export'
     Export the table, by default as a TAB-separated file.  Use for data
     exchange with, for example, spreadsheet or database programs.  The
     format used to export the file can be configured in the variable
     `org-table-export-default-format'.  You may also use properties
     `TABLE_EXPORT_FILE' and `TABLE_EXPORT_FORMAT' to specify the file
     name and the format for table export in a subtree.  Org supports
     quite general formats for exported tables.  The exporter format is
     the same as the format used by Orgtbl radio tables, see *note
     Translator functions::, for a detailed description.

   If you don't like the automatic table editor because it gets in your
way on lines which you would like to start with `|', you can turn it
off with

     (setq org-enable-table-editor nil)

Then the only table command that still works is `C-c C-c' to do a
manual re-align.

3.2 Column width and alignment
==============================

The width of columns is automatically determined by the table editor.
And also the alignment of a column is determined automatically from the
fraction of number-like versus non-number fields in the column.

   Sometimes a single field or a few fields need to carry more text,
leading to inconveniently wide columns.  To limit(1) the width of a
column, one field anywhere in the column may contain just the string
`<N>' where `N' is an integer specifying the width of the column in
characters.  The next re-align will then set the width of this column
to no more than this value.

     |---+------------------------------|               |---+--------|
     |   |                              |               |   | <6>    |
     | 1 | one                          |               | 1 | one    |
     | 2 | two                          |     ----\     | 2 | two    |
     | 3 | This is a long chunk of text |     ----/     | 3 | This=> |
     | 4 | four                         |               | 4 | four   |
     |---+------------------------------|               |---+--------|

Fields that are wider become clipped and end in the string `=>'.  Note
that the full text is still in the buffer, it is only invisible.  To
see the full text, hold the mouse over the field--a tool-tip window
will show the full content.  To edit such a field, use the command `C-c
`' (that is `C-c' followed by the backquote).  This will open a new
window with the full field.  Edit it and finish with `C-c C-c'.

   When visiting a file containing a table with narrowed columns, the
necessary character hiding has not yet happened, and the table needs to
be aligned before it looks nice.  Setting the option
`org-startup-align-all-tables' will realign all tables in a file upon
visiting, but also slow down startup.  You can also set this option on
a per-file basis with:

     #+STARTUP: align
     #+STARTUP: noalign

   If you would like to overrule the automatic alignment of number-rich
columns to the right and of string-rich column to the left, you and use
`<r>' or `<l>' in a similar fashion.  You may also combine alignment
and field width like this: `<l10>'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This feature does not work on XEmacs.


File: org,  Node: Column groups,  Next: Orgtbl mode,  Prev: Column width and alignment,  Up: Tables

3.3 Column groups
=================

When Org exports tables, it does so by default without vertical lines
because that is visually more satisfying in general.  Occasionally
however, vertical lines can be useful to structure a table into groups
of columns, much like horizontal lines can do for groups of rows.  In
order to specify column groups, you can use a special row where the
first field contains only `/'.  The further fields can either contain
`<' to indicate that this column should start a group, `>' to indicate
the end of a column, or `<>' to make a column a group of its own.
Boundaries between column groups will upon export be marked with
vertical lines.  Here is an example:

     |   |  N | N^2 | N^3 | N^4 | sqrt(n) | sqrt[4](N) |
     |---+----+-----+-----+-----+---------+------------|
     | / | <> |   < |     |   > |       < |          > |
     | # |  1 |   1 |   1 |   1 |       1 |          1 |
     | # |  2 |   4 |   8 |  16 |  1.4142 |     1.1892 |
     | # |  3 |   9 |  27 |  81 |  1.7321 |     1.3161 |
     |---+----+-----+-----+-----+---------+------------|
     #+TBLFM: $3=$2^2::$4=$2^3::$5=$2^4::$6=sqrt($2)::$7=sqrt(sqrt(($2)))

   It is also sufficient to just insert the column group starters after
every vertical line you'd like to have:

     |  N | N^2 | N^3 | N^4 | sqrt(n) | sqrt[4](N) |
     |----+-----+-----+-----+---------+------------|
     | /  | <   |     |     | <       |            |

3.4 The Orgtbl minor mode
=========================

If you like the intuitive way the Org table editor works, you might
also want to use it in other modes like Text mode or Mail mode.  The
minor mode Orgtbl mode makes this possible.  You can always toggle the
mode with `M-x orgtbl-mode'.  To turn it on by default, for example in
mail mode, use

     (add-hook 'mail-mode-hook 'turn-on-orgtbl)

   Furthermore, with some special setup, it is possible to maintain
tables in arbitrary syntax with Orgtbl mode.  For example, it is
possible to construct LaTeX tables with the underlying ease and power of
Orgtbl mode, including spreadsheet capabilities.  For details, see
*note Tables in arbitrary syntax::.

3.5 The spreadsheet
===================

The table editor makes use of the Emacs `calc' package to implement
spreadsheet-like capabilities.  It can also evaluate Emacs Lisp forms to
derive fields from other fields.  While fully featured, Org's
implementation is not identical to other spreadsheets.  For example,
Org knows the concept of a _column formula_ that will be applied to all
non-header fields in a column without having to copy the formula to
each relevant field.

3.5.1 References
----------------

To compute fields in the table from other fields, formulas must
reference other fields or ranges.  In Org, fields can be referenced by
name, by absolute coordinates, and by relative coordinates.  To find
out what the coordinates of a field are, press `C-c ?' in that field,
or press `C-c }' to toggle the display of a grid.

Field references
................

Formulas can reference the value of another field in two ways.  Like in
any other spreadsheet, you may reference fields with a letter/number
combination like `B3', meaning the 2nd field in the 3rd row.

Org also uses another, more general operator that looks like this:
     @ROW$COLUMN

Column references can be absolute like `1', `2',...`N', or relative to
the current column like `+1' or `-2'.

   The row specification only counts data lines and ignores horizontal
separator lines (hlines).  You can use absolute row numbers `1'...`N',
and row numbers relative to the current row like `+3' or `-1'.  Or
specify the row relative to one of the hlines: `I' refers to the first
hline(1), `II' to the second, etc.  `-I' refers to the first such line
above the current line, `+I' to the first such line below the current
line.  You can also write `III+2' which is the second data line after
the third hline in the table.

   `0' refers to the current row and column.  Also, if you omit either
the column or the row part of the reference, the current row/column is
implied.

   Org's references with _unsigned_ numbers are fixed references in the
sense that if you use the same reference in the formula for two
different fields, the same field will be referenced each time.  Org's
references with _signed_ numbers are floating references because the
same reference operator can reference different fields depending on the
field being calculated by the formula.

   As a special case, references like `$LR5' and `$LR12' can be used to
refer in a stable way to the 5th and 12th field in the last row of the
table.

   Here are a few examples:

     @2$3      2nd row, 3rd column
     C2        same as previous
     $5        column 5 in the current row
     E&        same as previous
     @2        current column, row 2
     @-1$-3    the field one row up, three columns to the left
     @-I$2     field just under hline above current row, column 2

Range references
................

You may reference a rectangular range of fields by specifying two field
references connected by two dots `..'.  If both fields are in the
current row, you may simply use `$2..$7', but if at least one field is
in a different row, you need to use the general `@row$column' format at
least for the first field (i.e the reference must start with `@' in
order to be interpreted correctly).  Examples:

     $1..$3        First three fields in the current row.
     $P..$Q        Range, using column names (see under Advanced)
     @2$1..@4$3    6 fields between these two fields.
     A2..C4        Same as above.
     @-1$-2..@-1   3 numbers from the column to the left, 2 up to current row

Range references return a vector of values that can be fed into Calc
vector functions.  Empty fields in ranges are normally suppressed, so
that the vector contains only the non-empty fields (but see the `E'
mode switch below).  If there are no non-empty fields, `[0]' is
returned to avoid syntax errors in formulas.

Named references
................

`$name' is interpreted as the name of a column, parameter or constant.
Constants are defined globally through the variable
`org-table-formula-constants', and locally (for the file) through a
line like

     #+CONSTANTS: c=299792458. pi=3.14 eps=2.4e-6

Also properties (*note Properties and Columns::) can be used as
constants in table formulas: for a property `:Xyz:' use the name
`$PROP_Xyz', and the property will be searched in the current outline
entry and in the hierarchy above it.  If you have the `constants.el'
package, it will also be used to resolve constants, including natural
constants like `$h' for Planck's constant, and units like `$km' for
kilometers(2).  Column names and parameters can be specified in special
table lines.  These are described below, see *note Advanced features::.
All names must start with a letter, and further consist of letters and
numbers.

Remote references
.................

You may also reference constants, fields and ranges from a different
table, either in the current file or even in a different file.  The
syntax is

     remote(NAME-OR-ID,REF)

where NAME can be the name of a table in the current file as set by a
`#+TBLNAME: NAME' line before the table.  It can also be the ID of an
entry, even in a different file, and the reference then refers to the
first table in that entry.  REF is an absolute field or range reference
as described above for example `@3$3' or `$somename', valid in the
referenced table.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that only hlines are counted that _separate_ table lines.
If the table starts with a hline above the header, it does not count.

   (2) `constants.el' can supply the values of constants in two
different unit systems, `SI' and `cgs'.  Which one is used depends on
the value of the variable `constants-unit-system'.  You can use the
`#+STARTUP' options `constSI' and `constcgs' to set this value for the
current buffer.

3.5.2 Formula syntax for Calc
-----------------------------

A formula can be any algebraic expression understood by the Emacs
`Calc' package.  Note that `calc' has the non-standard convention that
`/' has lower precedence than `*', so that `a/b*c' is interpreted as
`a/(b*c)'.  Before evaluation by `calc-eval' (*note calc-eval:
(Calc)Calling Calc from Your Programs.), variable substitution takes
place according to the rules described above.  The range vectors can be
directly fed into the Calc vector functions like `vmean' and `vsum'.

   A formula can contain an optional mode string after a semicolon.
This string consists of flags to influence Calc and other modes during
execution.  By default, Org uses the standard Calc modes (precision 12,
angular units degrees, fraction and symbolic modes off).  The display
format, however, has been changed to `(float 8)' to keep tables
compact.  The default settings can be configured using the variable
`org-calc-default-modes'.

     p20           switch the internal precision to 20 digits
     n3 s3 e2 f4   normal, scientific, engineering, or fixed display format
     D R           angle modes: degrees, radians
     F S           fraction and symbolic modes
     N             interpret all fields as numbers, use 0 for non-numbers
     T             force text interpretation
     E             keep empty fields in ranges
     L             literal

In addition, you may provide a `printf' format specifier to reformat
the final result.  A few examples:

     $1+$2                Sum of first and second field
     $1+$2;%.2f           Same, format result to two decimals
     exp($2)+exp($1)      Math functions can be used
     $0;%.1f              Reformat current cell to 1 decimal
     ($3-32)*5/9          Degrees F -> C conversion
     $c/$1/$cm            Hz -> cm conversion, using `constants.el'
     tan($1);Dp3s1        Compute in degrees, precision 3, display SCI 1
     sin($1);Dp3%.1e      Same, but use printf specifier for display
     vmean($2..$7)        Compute column range mean, using vector function
     vmean($2..$7);EN     Same, but treat empty fields as 0
     taylor($3,x=7,2)     taylor series of $3, at x=7, second degree

   Calc also contains a complete set of logical operations.  For example

     if($1<20,teen,string(""))  "teen" if age $1 less than 20, else empty


File: org,  Node: Formula syntax for Lisp,  Next: Field formulas,  Prev: Formula syntax for Calc,  Up: The spreadsheet

3.5.3 Emacs Lisp forms as formulas
----------------------------------

It is also possible to write a formula in Emacs Lisp; this can be useful
for string manipulation and control structures, if Calc's functionality
is not enough.  If a formula starts with a single-quote followed by an
opening parenthesis, then it is evaluated as a Lisp form.  The
evaluation should return either a string or a number.  Just as with
`calc' formulas, you can specify modes and a printf format after a
semicolon.  With Emacs Lisp forms, you need to be conscious about the
way field references are interpolated into the form.  By default, a
reference will be interpolated as a Lisp string (in double-quotes)
containing the field.  If you provide the `N' mode switch, all
referenced elements will be numbers (non-number fields will be zero) and
interpolated as Lisp numbers, without quotes.  If you provide the `L'
flag, all fields will be interpolated literally, without quotes.  I.e.,
if you want a reference to be interpreted as a string by the Lisp form,
enclose the reference operator itself in double-quotes, like `"$3"'.
Ranges are inserted as space-separated fields, so you can embed them in
list or vector syntax.  A few examples, note how the `N' mode is used
when we do computations in Lisp.

     Swap the first two characters of the content of column 1
       '(concat (substring $1 1 2) (substring $1 0 1) (substring $1 2))
     Add columns 1 and 2, equivalent to Calc's `$1+$2'
       '(+ $1 $2);N
     Compute the sum of columns 1-4, like Calc's `vsum($1..$4)'
       '(apply '+ '($1..$4));N


File: org,  Node: Field formulas,  Next: Column formulas,  Prev: Formula syntax for Lisp,  Up: The spreadsheet

3.5.4 Field formulas
--------------------

To assign a formula to a particular field, type it directly into the
field, preceded by `:=', for example `:=$1+$2'.  When you press <TAB>
or <RET> or `C-c C-c' with the cursor still in the field, the formula
will be stored as the formula for this field, evaluated, and the
current field replaced with the result.

   Formulas are stored in a special line starting with `#+TBLFM:'
directly below the table.  If you typed the equation in the 4th field of
the 3rd data line in the table, the formula will look like
`@3$4=$1+$2'.  When inserting/deleting/swapping column and rows with
the appropriate commands, absolute references (but not relative ones)
in stored formulas are modified in order to still reference the same
field.  Of course this is not true if you edit the table structure with
normal editing commands--then you must fix the equations yourself.  The
left-hand side of a formula may also be a named field (*note Advanced
features::), or a last-row reference like `$LR3'.

   Instead of typing an equation into the field, you may also use the
following command

`C-u C-c ='
     Install a new formula for the current field.  The command prompts
     for a formula with default taken from the `#+TBLFM:' line, applies
     it to the current field, and stores it.


File: org,  Node: Column formulas,  Next: Editing and debugging formulas,  Prev: Field formulas,  Up: The spreadsheet

3.5.5 Column formulas
---------------------

Often in a table, the same formula should be used for all fields in a
particular column.  Instead of having to copy the formula to all fields
in that column, Org allows you to assign a single formula to an entire
column.  If the table contains horizontal separator hlines, everything
before the first such line is considered part of the table _header_ and
will not be modified by column formulas.

   To assign a formula to a column, type it directly into any field in
the column, preceded by an equal sign, like `=$1+$2'.  When you press
<TAB> or <RET> or `C-c C-c' with the cursor still in the field, the
formula will be stored as the formula for the current column, evaluated
and the current field replaced with the result.  If the field contains
only `=', the previously stored formula for this column is used.  For
each column, Org will only remember the most recently used formula.  In
the `#+TBLFM:' line, column formulas will look like `$4=$1+$2'.  The
left-hand side of a column formula cannot currently be the name of
column, it must be the numeric column reference.

   Instead of typing an equation into the field, you may also use the
following command:

`C-c ='
     Install a new formula for the current column and replace current
     field with the result of the formula.  The command prompts for a
     formula, with default taken from the `#+TBLFM' line, applies it to
     the current field and stores it.  With a numeric prefix
     argument(e.g. `C-5 C-c =') the command will apply it to that many
     consecutive fields in the current column.


File: org,  Node: Editing and debugging formulas,  Next: Updating the table,  Prev: Column formulas,  Up: The spreadsheet

3.5.6 Editing and debugging formulas
------------------------------------

You can edit individual formulas in the minibuffer or directly in the
field.  Org can also prepare a special buffer with all active formulas
of a table.  When offering a formula for editing, Org converts
references to the standard format (like `B3' or `D&') if possible.  If
you prefer to only work with the internal format (like `@3$2' or `$4'),
configure the variable `org-table-use-standard-references'.

`C-c ='
`C-u C-c ='
     Edit the formula associated with the current column/field in the
     minibuffer.  See *note Column formulas::, and *note Field
     formulas::.  

`C-u C-u C-c ='
     Re-insert the active formula (either a field formula, or a column
     formula) into the current field, so that you can edit it directly
     in the field.  The advantage over editing in the minibuffer is
     that you can use the command `C-c ?'.  

`C-c ?'
     While editing a formula in a table field, highlight the field(s)
     referenced by the reference at the cursor position in the formula.  

`C-c }'
     Toggle the display of row and column numbers for a table, using
     overlays.  These are updated each time the table is aligned; you
     can force it with `C-c C-c'.  

`C-c {'
     Toggle the formula debugger on and off.  See below.  

`C-c ''
     Edit all formulas for the current table in a special buffer, where
     the formulas will be displayed one per line.  If the current field
     has an active formula, the cursor in the formula editor will mark
     it.  While inside the special buffer, Org will automatically
     highlight any field or range reference at the cursor position.
     You may edit, remove and add formulas, and use the following
     commands:
    `C-c C-c'
    `C-x C-s'
          Exit the formula editor and store the modified formulas.
          With `C-u' prefix, also apply the new formulas to the entire
          table.  

    `C-c C-q'
          Exit the formula editor without installing changes.  

    `C-c C-r'
          Toggle all references in the formula editor between standard
          (like `B3') and internal (like `@3$2').  

    `<TAB>'
          Pretty-print or indent Lisp formula at point.  When in a line
          containing a Lisp formula, format the formula according to
          Emacs Lisp rules.  Another <TAB> collapses the formula back
          again.  In the open formula, <TAB> re-indents just like in
          Emacs Lisp mode.  

    `M-<TAB>'
          Complete Lisp symbols, just like in Emacs Lisp mode.  

    `S-<up>/<down>/<left>/<right>'
          Shift the reference at point.  For example, if the reference
          is `B3' and you press `S-<right>', it will become `C3'.  This
          also works for relative references and for hline references.  

    `M-S-<up>/<down>'
          Move the test line for column formulas in the Org buffer up
          and down.  

    `M-<up>/<down>'
          Scroll the window displaying the table.  

    `C-c }'
          Turn the coordinate grid in the table on and off.

   Making a table field blank does not remove the formula associated
with the field, because that is stored in a different line (the
`#+TBLFM' line)--during the next recalculation the field will be filled
again.  To remove a formula from a field, you have to give an empty
reply when prompted for the formula, or to edit the `#+TBLFM' line.

   You may edit the `#+TBLFM' directly and re-apply the changed
equations with `C-c C-c' in that line or with the normal recalculation
commands in the table.

Debugging formulas
..................

When the evaluation of a formula leads to an error, the field content
becomes the string `#ERROR'.  If you would like see what is going on
during variable substitution and calculation in order to find a bug,
turn on formula debugging in the `Tbl' menu and repeat the calculation,
for example by pressing `C-u C-u C-c = <RET>' in a field.  Detailed
information will be displayed.

3.5.7 Updating the table
------------------------

Recalculation of a table is normally not automatic, but needs to be
triggered by a command.  See *note Advanced features::, for a way to
make recalculation at least semi-automatic.

   In order to recalculate a line of a table or the entire table, use
the following commands:

`C-c *'
     Recalculate the current row by first applying the stored column
     formulas from left to right, and all field formulas in the current
     row.  

`C-u C-c *'
`C-u C-c C-c'
     Recompute the entire table, line by line.  Any lines before the
     first hline are left alone, assuming that these are part of the
     table header.  

`C-u C-u C-c *'
`C-u C-u C-c C-c'
     Iterate the table by recomputing it until no further changes occur.
     This may be necessary if some computed fields use the value of
     other fields that are computed later in the calculation sequence.


File: org,  Node: Advanced features,  Prev: Updating the table,  Up: The spreadsheet

3.5.8 Advanced features
-----------------------

If you want the recalculation of fields to happen automatically, or if
you want to be able to assign names to fields and columns, you need to
reserve the first column of the table for special marking characters.
`C-#'
     Rotate the calculation mark in first column through the states ` ',
     `#', `*', `!', `$'.  When there is an active region, change all
     marks in the region.

   Here is an example of a table that collects exam results of students
and makes use of these features:

     |---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
     |   | Student | Prob 1 | Prob 2 | Prob 3 | Total | Note |
     |---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
     | ! |         |     P1 |     P2 |     P3 |   Tot |      |
     | # | Maximum |     10 |     15 |     25 |    50 | 10.0 |
     | ^ |         |     m1 |     m2 |     m3 |    mt |      |
     |---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
     | # | Peter   |     10 |      8 |     23 |    41 |  8.2 |
     | # | Sam     |      2 |      4 |      3 |     9 |  1.8 |
     |---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
     |   | Average |        |        |        |  29.7 |      |
     | ^ |         |        |        |        |    at |      |
     | $ | max=50  |        |        |        |       |      |
     |---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
     #+TBLFM: $6=vsum($P1..$P3)::$7=10*$Tot/$max;%.1f::$at=vmean(@-II..@-I);%.1f

Important: please note that for these special tables, recalculating the
table with `C-u C-c *' will only affect rows that are marked `#' or
`*', and fields that have a formula assigned to the field itself.  The
column formulas are not applied in rows with empty first field.

   The marking characters have the following meaning:
`!'
     The fields in this line define names for the columns, so that you
     may refer to a column as `$Tot' instead of `$6'.

`^'
     This row defines names for the fields _above_ the row.  With such
     a definition, any formula in the table may use `$m1' to refer to
     the value `10'.  Also, if you assign a formula to a names field, it
     will be stored as `$name=...'.

`_'
     Similar to `^', but defines names for the fields in the row
     _below_.

`$'
     Fields in this row can define _parameters_ for formulas.  For
     example, if a field in a `$' row contains `max=50', then formulas
     in this table can refer to the value 50 using `$max'.  Parameters
     work exactly like constants, only that they can be defined on a
     per-table basis.

`#'
     Fields in this row are automatically recalculated when pressing
     <TAB> or <RET> or `S-<TAB>' in this row.  Also, this row is
     selected for a global recalculation with `C-u C-c *'.  Unmarked
     lines will be left alone by this command.

`*'
     Selects this line for global recalculation with `C-u C-c *', but
     not for automatic recalculation.  Use this when automatic
     recalculation slows down editing too much.

`'
     Unmarked lines are exempt from recalculation with `C-u C-c *'.
     All lines that should be recalculated should be marked with `#' or
     `*'.

`/'
     Do not export this line.  Useful for lines that contain the
     narrowing `<N>' markers or column group markers.

   Finally, just to whet your appetite for what can be done with the
fantastic `calc.el' package, here is a table that computes the Taylor
series of degree `n' at location `x' for a couple of functions.

     |---+-------------+---+-----+--------------------------------------|
     |   | Func        | n | x   | Result                               |

3.6 Org-Plot
============

Org-Plot can produce 2D and 3D graphs of information stored in org
tables using `Gnuplot' `http://www.gnuplot.info/' and `gnuplot-mode'
`http://cars9.uchicago.edu/~ravel/software/gnuplot-mode.html'.  To see
this in action, ensure that you have both Gnuplot and Gnuplot mode
installed on your system, then call `org-plot/gnuplot' on the following
table.

     #+PLOT: title:"Citas" ind:1 deps:(3) type:2d with:histograms set:"yrange [0:]"
     | Sede      | Max cites | H-index |
     |-----------+-----------+---------|
     | Chile     |    257.72 |   21.39 |
     | Leeds     |    165.77 |   19.68 |
     | Sao Paolo |     71.00 |   11.50 |
     | Stockholm |    134.19 |   14.33 |
     | Morelia   |    257.56 |   17.67 |

   Notice that Org Plot is smart enough to apply the table's headers as
labels.  Further control over the labels, type, content, and appearance
of plots can be exercised through the `#+PLOT:' lines preceding a
table.  See below for a complete list of Org-plot options.  For more
information and examples see the Org-plot tutorial at
`http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-plot.php'.

Plot Options
............

`set'
     Specify any `gnuplot' option to be set when graphing.

`title'
     Specify the title of the plot.

`ind'
     Specify which column of the table to use as the `x' axis.

`deps'
     Specify the columns to graph as a Lisp style list, surrounded by
     parentheses and separated by spaces for example `dep:(3 4)' to
     graph the third and fourth columns (defaults to graphing all other
     columns aside from the `ind' column).

`type'
     Specify whether the plot will be `2d', `3d', or `grid'.

`with'
     Specify a `with' option to be inserted for every col being plotted
     (e.g. `lines', `points', `boxes', `impulses', etc...).  Defaults
     to `lines'.

`file'
     If you want to plot to a file, specify
     `"PATH/TO/DESIRED/OUTPUT-FILE"'.

`labels'
     List of labels to be used for the deps (defaults to the column
     headers if they exist).

`line'
     Specify an entire line to be inserted in the Gnuplot script.

`map'
     When plotting `3d' or `grid' types, set this to `t' to graph a
     flat mapping rather than a `3d' slope.

`timefmt'
     Specify format of Org-mode timestamps as they will be parsed by
     Gnuplot.  Defaults to `%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M:%S'.

`script'
     If you want total control, you can specify a script file (place
     the file name between double-quotes) which will be used to plot.
     Before plotting, every instance of `$datafile' in the specified
     script will be replaced with the path to the generated data file.
     Note: even if you set this option, you may still want to specify
     the plot type, as that can impact the content of the data file.

4.1 Link format
===============

Org will recognize plain URL-like links and activate them as clickable
links.  The general link format, however, looks like this:

     [[link][description]]       or alternatively           [[link]]

Once a link in the buffer is complete (all brackets present), Org will
change the display so that `description' is displayed instead of
`[[link][description]]' and `link' is displayed instead of `[[link]]'.
Links will be highlighted in the face `org-link', which by default is
an underlined face.  You can directly edit the visible part of a link.
Note that this can be either the `link' part (if there is no
description) or the `description' part.  To edit also the invisible
`link' part, use `C-c C-l' with the cursor on the link.

   If you place the cursor at the beginning or just behind the end of
the displayed text and press <BACKSPACE>, you will remove the
(invisible) bracket at that location.  This makes the link incomplete
and the internals are again displayed as plain text.  Inserting the
missing bracket hides the link internals again.  To show the internal
structure of all links, use the menu entry `Org->Hyperlinks->Literal
links'.

4.2 Internal links
==================

If the link does not look like a URL, it is considered to be internal
in the current file.  The most important case is a link like
`[[#my-custom-id]]' which will link to the entry with the `CUSTOM_ID'
property `my-custom-id'.  Such custom IDs are very good for HTML export
(*note HTML export::) where they produce pretty section links.  You are
responsible yourself to make sure these custom IDs are unique in a file.

   Links such as `[[My Target]]' or `[[My Target][Find my target]]'
lead to a text search in the current file.

   The link can be followed with `C-c C-o' when the cursor is on the
link, or with a mouse click (*note Handling links::).  Links to custom
IDs will point to the corresponding headline.  The preferred match for
a text link is a dedicated target: the same string in double angular
brackets.  Targets may be located anywhere; sometimes it is convenient
to put them into a comment line. For example

     # <<My Target>>

In HTML export (*note HTML export::), such targets will become named
anchors for direct access through `http' links(1).

   If no dedicated target exists, Org will search for the words in the
link.  In the above example the search would be for `my target'.  Links
starting with a star like `*My Target' restrict the search to
headlines(2).  When searching, Org mode will first try an exact match,
but then move on to more and more lenient searches.  For example, the
link `[[*My Targets]]' will find any of the following:

     ** My targets
     ** TODO my targets are bright
     ** my 20 targets are

   Following a link pushes a mark onto Org's own mark ring.  You can
return to the previous position with `C-c &'.  Using this command
several times in direct succession goes back to positions recorded
earlier.

* Menu:

* Radio targets::               Make targets trigger links in plain text

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that text before the first headline is usually not
exported, so the first such target should be after the first headline,
or in the line directly before the first headline.

   (2) To insert a link targeting a headline, in-buffer completion can
be used.  Just type a star followed by a few optional letters into the
buffer and press `M-<TAB>'.  All headlines in the current buffer will
be offered as completions.  *Note Handling links::, for more commands
creating links.

4.2.1 Radio targets
-------------------

Org can automatically turn any occurrences of certain target names in
normal text into a link.  So without explicitly creating a link, the
text connects to the target radioing its position.  Radio targets are
enclosed by triple angular brackets.  For example, a target `<<<My
Target>>>' causes each occurrence of `my target' in normal text to
become activated as a link.  The Org file is scanned automatically for
radio targets only when the file is first loaded into Emacs.  To update
the target list during editing, press `C-c C-c' with the cursor on or
at a target.

4.3 External links
==================

Org supports links to files, websites, Usenet and email messages, BBDB
database entries and links to both IRC conversations and their logs.
External links are URL-like locators.  They start with a short
identifying string followed by a colon.  There can be no space after
the colon.  The following list shows examples for each link type.

     elisp:(find-file-other-frame "Elisp.org") Elisp form to evaluate

   A link should be enclosed in double brackets and may contain a
descriptive text to be displayed instead of the URL (*note Link
format::), for example:

     [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]]

If the description is a file name or URL that points to an image, HTML
export (*note HTML export::) will inline the image as a clickable
button.  If there is no description at all and the link points to an
image, that image will be inlined into the exported HTML file.

   Org also finds external links in the normal text and activates them
as links.  If spaces must be part of the link (for example in
`bbdb:Richard Stallman'), or if you need to remove ambiguities about
the end of the link, enclose them in square brackets.

4.4 Handling links
==================

Org provides methods to create a link in the correct syntax, to insert
it into an Org file, and to follow the link.

`C-c l'
     Store a link to the current location.  This is a _global_ command
     (you must create the key binding yourself) which can be used in
     any buffer to create a link.  The link will be stored for later
     insertion into an Org buffer (see below).  What kind of link will
     be created depends on the current buffer:

     Org-mode buffers
     For Org files, if there is a `<<target>>' at the cursor, the link
     points to the target.  Otherwise it points to the current
     headline, which will also be the description.

     If the headline has a `CUSTOM_ID' property, a link to this custom
     ID will be stored.  In addition or alternatively (depending on the
     value of `org-link-to-org-use-id'), a globally unique `ID'
     property will be created and/or used to construct a link.  So
     using this command in Org buffers will potentially create two
     links: a human-readable from the custom ID, and one that is
     globally unique and works even if the entry is moved from file to
     file.  Later, when inserting the link, you need to decide which one
     to use.

     Email/News clients: VM, Rmail, Wanderlust, MH-E, Gnus
     Pretty much all Emacs mail clients are supported.  The link will
     point to the current article, or, in some GNUS buffers, to the
     group.  The description is constructed from the author and the
     subject.

     Web browsers: W3 and W3M
     Here the link will be the current URL, with the page title as
     description.

     Contacts: BBDB
     Links created in a BBDB buffer will point to the current entry.

     Chat: IRC
     For IRC links, if you set the variable `org-irc-link-to-logs' to
     `t', a `file:/' style link to the relevant point in the logs for
     the current conversation is created.  Otherwise an `irc:/' style
     link to the user/channel/server under the point will be stored.

     Other files
     For any other files, the link will point to the file, with a
     search string (*note Search options::) pointing to the contents of
     the current line.  If there is an active region, the selected
     words will form the basis of the search string.  If the
     automatically created link is not working correctly or accurately
     enough, you can write custom functions to select the search string
     and to do the search for particular file types--see *note Custom
     searches::.  The key binding `C-c l' is only a suggestion--see
     *note Installation::.

     Agenda view
     When the cursor is in an agenda view, the created link points to
     the entry referenced by the current line.

`C-c C-l'
     Insert a link(1).  This prompts for a link to be inserted into the
     buffer.  You can just type a link, using text for an internal
     link, or one of the link type prefixes mentioned in the examples
     above.  The link will be inserted into the buffer(2), along with a
     descriptive text.  If some text was selected when this command is
     called, the selected text becomes the default description.

     Inserting stored links
     All links stored during the current session are part of the
     history for this prompt, so you can access them with <up> and
     <down> (or `M-p/n').

     Completion support
     Completion with <TAB> will help you to insert valid link prefixes
     like `http:' or `ftp:', including the prefixes defined through
     link abbreviations (*note Link abbreviations::).  If you press
     <RET> after inserting only the PREFIX, Org will offer specific
     completion support for some link types(3)  For example, if you
     type `file <RET>', file name completion (alternative access: `C-u
     C-c C-l', see below) will be offered, and after `bbdb <RET>' you
     can complete contact names.  

`C-u C-c C-l'
     When `C-c C-l' is called with a `C-u' prefix argument, a link to a
     file will be inserted and you may use file name completion to
     select the name of the file.  The path to the file is inserted
     relative to the directory of the current Org file, if the linked
     file is in the current directory or in a sub-directory of it, or
     if the path is written relative to the current directory using
     `../'.  Otherwise an absolute path is used, if possible with `~/'
     for your home directory.  You can force an absolute path with two
     `C-u' prefixes.

`C-c C-l (with cursor on existing link)'
     When the cursor is on an existing link, `C-c C-l' allows you to
     edit the link and description parts of the link.  

`C-c C-o or <RET>'
     Open link at point.  This will launch a web browser for URLs (using
     `browse-url-at-point'), run VM/MH-E/Wanderlust/Rmail/Gnus/BBDB for
     the corresponding links, and execute the command in a shell link.
     When the cursor is on an internal link, this commands runs the
     corresponding search.  When the cursor is on a TAG list in a
     headline, it creates the corresponding TAGS view.  If the cursor
     is on a timestamp, it compiles the agenda for that date.
     Furthermore, it will visit text and remote files in `file:' links
     with Emacs and select a suitable application for local non-text
     files.  Classification of files is based on file extension only.
     See option `org-file-apps'.  If you want to override the default
     application and visit the file with Emacs, use a `C-u' prefix.  If
     you want to avoid opening in Emacs, use a `C-u C-u' prefix.
     If the cursor is on a headline, but not on a link, offer all links
     in the headline and entry text.  

`mouse-2'
`mouse-1'
     On links, `mouse-2' will open the link just as `C-c C-o' would.
     Under Emacs 22, `mouse-1' will also follow a link.  

`mouse-3'
     Like `mouse-2', but force file links to be opened with Emacs, and
     internal links to be displayed in another window(4).  

`C-c %'
     Push the current position onto the mark ring, to be able to return
     easily. Commands following an internal link do this automatically.  

`C-c &'
     Jump back to a recorded position.  A position is recorded by the
     commands following internal links, and by `C-c %'.  Using this
     command several times in direct succession moves through a ring of
     previously recorded positions.  

`C-c C-x C-n'
`C-c C-x C-p'
     Move forward/backward to the next link in the buffer.  At the
     limit of the buffer, the search fails once, and then wraps around.
     The key bindings for this are really too long, you might want to
     bind this also to `C-n' and `C-p'
          (add-hook 'org-load-hook
            (lambda ()
              (define-key 'org-mode-map "\C-n" 'org-next-link)
              (define-key 'org-mode-map "\C-p" 'org-previous-link)))

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1)  Note that you don't have to use this command to insert a link.
Links in Org are plain text, and you can type or paste them straight
into the buffer.  By using this command, the links are automatically
enclosed in double brackets, and you will be asked for the optional
descriptive text.

   (2) After insertion of a stored link, the link will be removed from
the list of stored links.  To keep it in the list later use, use a
triple `C-u' prefix argument to `C-c C-l', or configure the option
`org-keep-stored-link-after-insertion'.

   (3) This works by calling a special function
`org-PREFIX-complete-link'.

   (4) See the variable `org-display-internal-link-with-indirect-buffer'

4.5 Using links outside Org
===========================

You can insert and follow links that have Org syntax not only in Org,
but in any Emacs buffer.  For this, you should create two global
commands, like this (please select suitable global keys yourself):

     (global-set-key "\C-c L" 'org-insert-link-global)
     (global-set-key "\C-c o" 'org-open-at-point-global)


File: org,  Node: Link abbreviations,  Next: Search options,  Prev: Using links outside Org,  Up: Hyperlinks

4.6 Link abbreviations
======================

Long URLs can be cumbersome to type, and often many similar links are
needed in a document.  For this you can use link abbreviations.  An
abbreviated link looks like this

     [[linkword:tag][description]]

where the tag is optional.  The linkword must be a word; letter,
numbers, `-', and `_' are allowed here.  Abbreviations are resolved
according to the information in the variable `org-link-abbrev-alist'
that relates the linkwords to replacement text.  Here is an example:

     (setq org-link-abbrev-alist
       '(("bugzilla" . "http://10.1.2.9/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=")
         ("google"   . "http://www.google.com/search?q=")
         ("ads"      . "http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/
                        nph-abs_connect?author=%s&db_key=AST")))

   If the replacement text contains the string `%s', it will be
replaced with the tag.  Otherwise the tag will be appended to the string
in order to create the link.  You may also specify a function that will
be called with the tag as the only argument to create the link.

   With the above setting, you could link to a specific bug with
`[[bugzilla:129]]', search the web for `OrgMode' with
`[[google:OrgMode]]' and find out what the Org author is doing besides
Emacs hacking with `[[ads:Dominik,C]]'.

   If you need special abbreviations just for a single Org buffer, you
can define them in the file with

     #+LINK: bugzilla  http://10.1.2.9/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=
     #+LINK: google    http://www.google.com/search?q=%s

In-buffer completion (*note Completion::) can be used after `[' to
complete link abbreviations.  You may also define a function
`org-PREFIX-complete-link' that implements special (e.g. completion)
support for inserting such a link with `C-c C-l'.  Such a function
should not accept any arguments, and return the full link with prefix.


File: org,  Node: Search options,  Next: Custom searches,  Prev: Link abbreviations,  Up: Hyperlinks

4.7 Search options in file links
================================

File links can contain additional information to make Emacs jump to a
particular location in the file when following a link.  This can be a
line number or a search option after a double(1) colon. For example,
when the command `C-c l' creates a link (*note Handling links::) to a
file, it encodes the words in the current line as a search string that
can be used to find this line back later when following the link with
`C-c C-o'.

   Here is the syntax of the different ways to attach a search to a file
link, together with an explanation:

     [[file:~/code/main.c::255]]
     [[file:~/xx.org::My Target]]
     [[file:~/xx.org::*My Target]]
     [[file:~/xx.org::/regexp/]]

`255'
     Jump to line 255.

`My Target'
     Search for a link target `<<My Target>>', or do a text search for
     `my target', similar to the search in internal links, see *note
     Internal links::.  In HTML export (*note HTML export::), such a
     file link will become an HTML reference to the corresponding named
     anchor in the linked file.

`*My Target'
     In an Org file, restrict search to headlines.

`/regexp/'
     Do a regular expression search for `regexp'.  This uses the Emacs
     command `occur' to list all matches in a separate window.  If the
     target file is in Org mode, `org-occur' is used to create a sparse
     tree with the matches.

   As a degenerate case, a file link with an empty file name can be used
to search the current file.  For example, `[[file:::find me]]' does a
search for `find me' in the current file, just as `[[find me]]' would.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) For backward compatibility, line numbers can also follow a
single colon.


File: org,  Node: Custom searches,  Prev: Search options,  Up: Hyperlinks

4.8 Custom Searches
===================

The default mechanism for creating search strings and for doing the
actual search related to a file link may not work correctly in all
cases.  For example, BibTeX database files have many entries like
`year="1993"' which would not result in good search strings, because
the only unique identification for a BibTeX entry is the citation key.

   If you come across such a problem, you can write custom functions to
set the right search string for a particular file type, and to do the
search for the string in the file.  Using `add-hook', these functions
need to be added to the hook variables
`org-create-file-search-functions' and
`org-execute-file-search-functions'.  See the docstring for these
variables for more information.  Org actually uses this mechanism for
BibTeX database files, and you can use the corresponding code as an
implementation example.  See the file `org-bibtex.el'.


File: org,  Node: TODO Items,  Next: Tags,  Prev: Hyperlinks,  Up: Top

5 TODO Items
************

Org mode does not maintain TODO lists as separate documents(1).
Instead, TODO items are an integral part of the notes file, because
TODO items usually come up while taking notes!  With Org mode, simply
mark any entry in a tree as being a TODO item.  In this way,
information is not duplicated, and the entire context from which the
TODO item emerged is always present.

   Of course, this technique for managing TODO items scatters them
throughout your notes file.  Org mode compensates for this by providing
methods to give you an overview of all the things that you have to do.

* Menu:

* TODO basics::                 Marking and displaying TODO entries
* TODO extensions::             Workflow and assignments
* Progress logging::            Dates and notes for progress
* Priorities::                  Some things are more important than others
* Breaking down tasks::         Splitting a task into manageable pieces
* Checkboxes::                  Tick-off lists

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Of course, you can make a document that contains only long lists
of TODO items, but this is not required.


File: org,  Node: TODO basics,  Next: TODO extensions,  Prev: TODO Items,  Up: TODO Items

5.1 Basic TODO functionality
============================

Any headline becomes a TODO item when it starts with the word `TODO',
for example:

     *** TODO Write letter to Sam Fortune

The most important commands to work with TODO entries are:

`C-c C-t'
     Rotate the TODO state of the current item among

          ,-> (unmarked) -> TODO -> DONE --.
          '--------------------------------'

     The same rotation can also be done "remotely" from the timeline and
     agenda buffers with the `t' command key (*note Agenda commands::).

`C-u C-c C-t'
     Select a specific keyword using completion or (if it has been set
     up) the fast selection interface.  For the latter, you need to
     assign keys to TODO states, see *note Per-file keywords::, and
     *note Setting tags::, for more information.

`S-<right>'
`S-<left>'
     Select the following/preceding TODO state, similar to cycling.
     Useful mostly if more than two TODO states are possible (*note
     TODO extensions::).  See also *note Conflicts::, for a discussion
     of the interaction with `shift-selection-mode'.  See also the
     variable `org-treat-S-cursor-todo-selection-as-state-change'.  

`C-c C-v'
`C-c / t'
     View TODO items in a _sparse tree_ (*note Sparse trees::).  Folds
     the entire buffer, but shows all TODO items and the headings
     hierarchy above them.  With a prefix argument, search for a
     specific TODO.  You will be prompted for the keyword, and you can
     also give a list of keywords like `KWD1|KWD2|...' to list entries
     that match any one of these keywords.  With numeric prefix
     argument N, show the tree for the Nth keyword in the variable
     `org-todo-keywords'.  With two prefix arguments, find all TODO and
     DONE entries.  

`C-c a t'
     Show the global TODO list.  Collects the TODO items from all agenda
     files (*note Agenda Views::) into a single buffer.  The new buffer

     manipulate the TODO entries from the new buffer (*note Agenda
     commands::).  *Note Global TODO list::, for more information.

     Insert a new TODO entry below the current one.

Changing a TODO state can also trigger tag changes.  See the docstring

5.2 Extended use of TODO keywords
=================================

By default, marked TODO entries have one of only two states: TODO and
DONE.  Org mode allows you to classify TODO items in more complex ways
with _TODO keywords_ (stored in `org-todo-keywords').  With special
setup, the TODO keyword system can work differently in different files.

   Note that tags are another way to classify headlines in general and
TODO items in particular (*note Tags::).

* Menu:

* Workflow states::             From TODO to DONE in steps
* TODO types::                  I do this, Fred does the rest
* Multiple sets in one file::   Mixing it all, and still finding your way
* Fast access to TODO states::  Single letter selection of a state
* Per-file keywords::           Different files, different requirements
* Faces for TODO keywords::     Highlighting states
* TODO dependencies::           When one task needs to wait for others


File: org,  Node: Workflow states,  Next: TODO types,  Prev: TODO extensions,  Up: TODO extensions

5.2.1 TODO keywords as workflow states
--------------------------------------

You can use TODO keywords to indicate different _sequential_ states in
the process of working on an item, for example(1):

     (setq org-todo-keywords
       '((sequence "TODO" "FEEDBACK" "VERIFY" "|" "DONE" "DELEGATED")))

   The vertical bar separates the TODO keywords (states that _need
action_) from the DONE states (which need _no further action_).  If you
don't provide the separator bar, the last state is used as the DONE
state.  With this setup, the command `C-c C-t' will cycle an entry from
TODO to FEEDBACK, then to VERIFY, and finally to DONE and DELEGATED.
You may also use a numeric prefix argument to quickly select a specific
state.  For example `C-3 C-c C-t' will change the state immediately to
VERIFY.  Or you can use `S-<left>' to go backward through the sequence.
If you define many keywords, you can use in-buffer completion (*note
Completion::) or even a special one-key selection scheme (*note Fast
access to TODO states::) to insert these words into the buffer.
Changing a TODO state can be logged with a timestamp, see *note
Tracking TODO state changes::, for more information.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Changing this variable only becomes effective after restarting
Org mode in a buffer.


File: org,  Node: TODO types,  Next: Multiple sets in one file,  Prev: Workflow states,  Up: TODO extensions

5.2.2 TODO keywords as types
----------------------------

The second possibility is to use TODO keywords to indicate different
_types_ of action items.  For example, you might want to indicate that
items are for "work" or "home".  Or, when you work with several people
on a single project, you might want to assign action items directly to
persons, by using their names as TODO keywords.  This would be set up
like this:

     (setq org-todo-keywords '((type "Fred" "Sara" "Lucy" "|" "DONE")))

   In this case, different keywords do not indicate a sequence, but
rather different types.  So the normal work flow would be to assign a
task to a person, and later to mark it DONE.  Org mode supports this
style by adapting the workings of the command `C-c C-t'(1).  When used
several times in succession, it will still cycle through all names, in
order to first select the right type for a task.  But when you return
to the item after some time and execute `C-c C-t' again, it will switch
from any name directly to DONE.  Use prefix arguments or completion to
quickly select a specific name.  You can also review the items of a
specific TODO type in a sparse tree by using a numeric prefix to `C-c
C-v'.  For example, to see all things Lucy has to do, you would use
`C-3 C-c C-v'.  To collect Lucy's items from all agenda files into a
single buffer, you would use the numeric prefix argument as well when
creating the global TODO list: `C-3 C-c t'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This is also true for the `t' command in the timeline and agenda
buffers.


File: org,  Node: Multiple sets in one file,  Next: Fast access to TODO states,  Prev: TODO types,  Up: TODO extensions

5.2.3 Multiple keyword sets in one file
---------------------------------------

Sometimes you may want to use different sets of TODO keywords in
parallel.  For example, you may want to have the basic `TODO'/`DONE',
but also a workflow for bug fixing, and a separate state indicating
that an item has been canceled (so it is not DONE, but also does not
require action).  Your setup would then look like this:

     (setq org-todo-keywords
           '((sequence "TODO" "|" "DONE")
             (sequence "REPORT" "BUG" "KNOWNCAUSE" "|" "FIXED")
             (sequence "|" "CANCELED")))

   The keywords should all be different, this helps Org mode to keep
track of which subsequence should be used for a given entry.  In this
setup, `C-c C-t' only operates within a subsequence, so it switches from
`DONE' to (nothing) to `TODO', and from `FIXED' to (nothing) to
`REPORT'.  Therefore you need a mechanism to initially select the
correct sequence.  Besides the obvious ways like typing a keyword or
using completion, you may also apply the following commands:

`C-u C-u C-c C-t'
`C-S-<right>'
`C-S-<left>'
     These keys jump from one TODO subset to the next.  In the above
     example, `C-u C-u C-c C-t' or `C-S-<right>' would jump from `TODO'
     or `DONE' to `REPORT', and any of the words in the second row to
     `CANCELED'.  Note that the `C-S-' key binding conflict with
     `shift-selection-mode' (*note Conflicts::).  

`S-<right>'
`S-<left>'
     `S-<<left>>' and `S-<<right>>' and walk through _all_ keywords
     from all sets, so for example `S-<<right>>' would switch from
     `DONE' to `REPORT' in the example above.  See also *note
     Conflicts::, for a discussion of the interaction with
     `shift-selection-mode'.

5.2.4 Fast access to TODO states
--------------------------------

If you would like to quickly change an entry to an arbitrary TODO state
instead of cycling through the states, you can set up keys for
single-letter access to the states.  This is done by adding the section
key after each keyword, in parentheses.  For example:

     (setq org-todo-keywords
           '((sequence "TODO(t)" "|" "DONE(d)")
             (sequence "REPORT(r)" "BUG(b)" "KNOWNCAUSE(k)" "|" "FIXED(f)")
             (sequence "|" "CANCELED(c)")))

   If you then press `C-c C-t' followed by the selection key, the entry
will be switched to this state.  <SPC> can be used to remove any TODO
keyword from an entry.(1)

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Check also the variable `org-fast-tag-selection-include-todo',
it allows you to change the TODO state through the tags interface
(*note Setting tags::), in case you like to mingle the two concepts.
Note that this means you need to come up with unique keys across both
sets of keywords.


File: org,  Node: Per-file keywords,  Next: Faces for TODO keywords,  Prev: Fast access to TODO states,  Up: TODO extensions

5.2.5 Setting up keywords for individual files
----------------------------------------------

It can be very useful to use different aspects of the TODO mechanism in
different files.  For file-local settings, you need to add special lines
to the file which set the keywords and interpretation for that file
only.  For example, to set one of the two examples discussed above, you
need one of the following lines, starting in column zero anywhere in the
file:

     #+TODO: TODO FEEDBACK VERIFY | DONE CANCELED
   (you may also write `#+SEQ_TODO' to be explicit about the
interpretation, but it means the same as `#+TODO'), or
     #+TYP_TODO: Fred Sara Lucy Mike | DONE

   A setup for using several sets in parallel would be:

     #+TODO: TODO | DONE
     #+TODO: REPORT BUG KNOWNCAUSE | FIXED
     #+TODO: | CANCELED

To make sure you are using the correct keyword, type `#+' into the
buffer and then use `M-<TAB>' completion.

   Remember that the keywords after the vertical bar (or the last
keyword if no bar is there) must always mean that the item is DONE
(although you may use a different word).  After changing one of these
lines, use `C-c C-c' with the cursor still in the line to make the
changes known to Org mode(1).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Org mode parses these lines only when Org mode is activated
after visiting a file.  `C-c C-c' with the cursor in a line starting
with `#+' is simply restarting Org mode for the current buffer.


File: org,  Node: Faces for TODO keywords,  Next: TODO dependencies,  Prev: Per-file keywords,  Up: TODO extensions

5.2.6 Faces for TODO keywords
-----------------------------

Org mode highlights TODO keywords with special faces: `org-todo' for
keywords indicating that an item still has to be acted upon, and
`org-done' for keywords indicating that an item is finished.  If you
are using more than 2 different states, you might want to use special
faces for some of them.  This can be done using the variable
`org-todo-keyword-faces'.  For example:

     (setq org-todo-keyword-faces
           '(("TODO"      . org-warning)
             ("DEFERRED"  . shadow)
             ("CANCELED"  . (:foreground "blue" :weight bold))))

   While using a list with face properties as shown for CANCELED
_should_ work, this does not aways seem to be the case.  If necessary,
define a special face and use that.


File: org,  Node: TODO dependencies,  Prev: Faces for TODO keywords,  Up: TODO extensions

5.2.7 TODO dependencies
-----------------------

The structure of Org files (hierarchy and lists) makes it easy to
define TODO dependencies.  Usually, a parent TODO task should not be
marked DONE until all subtasks (defined as children tasks) are marked
as DONE.  And sometimes there is a logical sequence to a number of
(sub)tasks, so that one task cannot be acted upon before all siblings
above it are done.  If you customize the variable
`org-enforce-todo-dependencies', Org will block entries from changing
state to DONE while they have children that are not DONE.  Furthermore,
if an entry has a property `ORDERED', each of its children will be
blocked until all earlier siblings are marked DONE.  Here is an example:

     * TODO Blocked until (two) is done
     ** DONE one
     ** TODO two

     * Parent
       :PROPERTIES:
         :ORDERED: t
       :END:
     ** TODO a
     ** TODO b, needs to wait for (a)
     ** TODO c, needs to wait for (a) and (b)

`C-c C-x o'
     Toggle the `ORDERED' property of the current entry.  A property is
     used for this behavior because this should be local to the current
     entry, not inherited like a tag.  However, if you would like to
     track the value of this property with a tag for better visibility,
     customize the variable `org-track-ordered-property-with-tag'.  

`C-u C-u C-u C-c C-t'
     Change TODO state, circumventing any state blocking.

   If you set the variable `org-agenda-dim-blocked-tasks', TODO entries
that cannot be closed because of such dependencies will be shown in a
dimmed font or even made invisible in agenda views (*note Agenda
Views::).

   You can also block changes of TODO states by looking at checkboxes
(*note Checkboxes::).  If you set the variable
`org-enforce-todo-checkbox-dependencies', an entry that has unchecked
checkboxes will be blocked from switching to DONE.

   If you need more complex dependency structures, for example
dependencies between entries in different trees or files, check out the
contributed module `org-depend.el'.


File: org,  Node: Progress logging,  Next: Priorities,  Prev: TODO extensions,  Up: TODO Items

5.3 Progress logging
====================

Org mode can automatically record a timestamp and possibly a note when
you mark a TODO item as DONE, or even each time you change the state of
a TODO item.  This system is highly configurable, settings can be on a
per-keyword basis and can be localized to a file or even a subtree.  For
information on how to clock working time for a task, see *note Clocking
work time::.

* Menu:

* Closing items::               When was this entry marked DONE?
* Tracking TODO state changes::  When did the status change?
* Tracking your habits::        How consistent have you been?


File: org,  Node: Closing items,  Next: Tracking TODO state changes,  Prev: Progress logging,  Up: Progress logging

5.3.1 Closing items
-------------------

The most basic logging is to keep track of _when_ a certain TODO item
was finished.  This is achieved with(1).

     (setq org-log-done 'time)

Then each time you turn an entry from a TODO (not-done) state into any
of the DONE states, a line `CLOSED: [timestamp]' will be inserted just
after the headline.  If you turn the entry back into a TODO item
through further state cycling, that line will be removed again.  If you
want to record a note along with the timestamp, use(2)

     (setq org-log-done 'note)

You will then be prompted for a note, and that note will be stored below
the entry with a `Closing Note' heading.

   In the timeline (*note Timeline::) and in the agenda (*note
Weekly/daily agenda::), you can then use the `l' key to display the
TODO items with a `CLOSED' timestamp on each day, giving you an
overview of what has been done.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The corresponding in-buffer setting is: `#+STARTUP: logdone'

   (2) The corresponding in-buffer setting is: `#+STARTUP: lognotedone'


File: org,  Node: Tracking TODO state changes,  Next: Tracking your habits,  Prev: Closing items,  Up: Progress logging

5.3.2 Tracking TODO state changes
---------------------------------

When TODO keywords are used as workflow states (*note Workflow
states::), you might want to keep track of when a state change occurred
and maybe take a note about this change.  You can either record just a
timestamp, or a time-stamped note for a change.  These records will be
inserted after the headline as an itemized list, newest first(1).  When
taking a lot of notes, you might want to get the notes out of the way
into a drawer (*note Drawers::).  Customize the variable
`org-log-into-drawer' to get this behavior--the recommended drawer for
this is called `LOGBOOK'.  You can also overrule the setting of this
variable for a subtree by setting a `LOG_INTO_DRAWER' property.

   Since it is normally too much to record a note for every state, Org
mode expects configuration on a per-keyword basis for this.  This is
achieved by adding special markers `!' (for a timestamp) and `@' (for a
note) in parentheses after each keyword.  For example, with the setting

     (setq org-todo-keywords
       '((sequence "TODO(t)" "WAIT(w@/!)" "|" "DONE(d!)" "CANCELED(c@)")))

you not only define global TODO keywords and fast access keys, but also
request that a time is recorded when the entry is set to DONE(2), and
that a note is recorded when switching to WAIT or CANCELED.  The
setting for WAIT is even more special: the `!' after the slash means
that in addition to the note taken when entering the state, a timestamp
should be recorded when leaving the WAIT state, if and only if the
target state does not configure logging for entering it.  So it has no
effect when switching from WAIT to DONE, because DONE is configured to
record a timestamp only.  But when switching from WAIT back to TODO,
the `/!' in the WAIT setting now triggers a timestamp even though TODO
has no logging configured.

   You can use the exact same syntax for setting logging preferences
local to a buffer:
     #+TODO: TODO(t) WAIT(w@/!) | DONE(d!) CANCELED(c@)

   In order to define logging settings that are local to a subtree or a
single item, define a LOGGING property in this entry.  Any non-empty
LOGGING property resets all logging settings to nil.  You may then turn
on logging for this specific tree using STARTUP keywords like
`lognotedone' or `logrepeat', as well as adding state specific settings
like `TODO(!)'.  For example

     * TODO Log each state with only a time
       :PROPERTIES:
       :LOGGING: TODO(!) WAIT(!) DONE(!) CANCELED(!)
       :END:
     * TODO Only log when switching to WAIT, and when repeating
       :PROPERTIES:
       :LOGGING: WAIT(@) logrepeat
       :END:
     * TODO No logging at all
       :PROPERTIES:
       :LOGGING: nil
       :END:

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) See the variable `org-log-states-order-reversed'

   (2) It is possible that Org mode will record two timestamps when you
are using both `org-log-done' and state change logging.  However, it
will never prompt for two notes--if you have configured both, the state
change recording note will take precedence and cancel the `Closing
Note'.


File: org,  Node: Tracking your habits,  Prev: Tracking TODO state changes,  Up: Progress logging

5.3.3 Tracking your habits
--------------------------

Org has the ability to track the consistency of a special category of
TODOs, called "habits".  A habit has the following properties:

  1. You have enabled the `habits' module by customizing the variable
     `org-modules'.

  2. The habit is a TODO, with a TODO keyword representing an open
     state.

  3. The property `STYLE' is set to the value `habit'.

  4. The TODO has a scheduled date, with a `.+' style repeat interval.

  5. The TODO may also have minimum and maximum ranges specified by
     using the syntax `.+2d/3d', which says that you want to do the
     task at least every three days, but at most every two days.

  6. You must also have state logging for the `DONE' state enabled, in
     order for historical data to be represented in the consistency
     graph.  If it's not enabled it's not an error, but the consistency
     graphs will be largely meaningless.

   To give you an idea of what the above rules look like in action,
here's an actual habit with some history:

     ** TODO Shave
        SCHEDULED: <2009-10-17 Sat .+2d/4d>
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-10-15 Thu]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-10-12 Mon]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-10-10 Sat]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-10-04 Sun]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-10-02 Fri]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-09-29 Tue]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-09-25 Fri]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-09-19 Sat]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-09-16 Wed]
        - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-09-12 Sat]
        :PROPERTIES:
        :STYLE:    habit
        :LAST_REPEAT: [2009-10-19 Mon 00:36]
        :END:

   What this habit says is: I want to shave at most every 2 days (given
by the `SCHEDULED' date and repeat interval) and at least every 4 days.
If today is the 15th, then the habit first appears in the agenda on Oct
17, after the minimum of 2 days has elapsed, and will appear overdue on
Oct 19, after four days have elapsed.

   What's really useful about habits is that they are displayed along
with a consistency graph, to show how consistent you've been at getting
that task done in the past.  This graph shows every day that the task
was done over the past three weeks, with colors for each day.  The
colors used are:

`Blue'
     If the task wasn't to be done yet on that day.

`Green'
     If the task could have been done on that day.

`Yellow'
     If the task was going to be overdue the next day.

`Red'
     If the task was overdue on that day.

   In addition to coloring each day, the day is also marked with an
asterix if the task was actually done that day, and an exclamation mark
to show where the current day falls in the graph.

   There are several configuration variables that can be used to change
the way habits are displayed in the agenda.

`org-habit-graph-column'
     The buffer column at which the consistency graph should be drawn.
     This will overwrite any text in that column, so it's a good idea
     to keep your habits' titles brief and to the point.

`org-habit-preceding-days'
     The amount of history, in days before today, to appear in
     consistency graphs.

`org-habit-following-days'
     The number of days after today that will appear in consistency
     graphs.

`org-habit-show-habits-only-for-today'
     If non-nil, only show habits in today's agenda view.  This is set
     to true by default.

   Lastly, pressing `K' in the agenda buffer will cause habits to
temporarily be disabled and they won't appear at all.  Press `K' again
to bring them back.  They are also subject to tag filtering, if you
have habits which should only be done in certain contexts, for example.


File: org,  Node: Priorities,  Next: Breaking down tasks,  Prev: Progress logging,  Up: TODO Items

5.4 Priorities
==============

If you use Org mode extensively, you may end up enough TODO items that
it starts to make sense to prioritize them.  Prioritizing can be done by
placing a _priority cookie_ into the headline of a TODO item, like this

     *** TODO [#A] Write letter to Sam Fortune

By default, Org mode supports three priorities: `A', `B', and `C'.  `A'
is the highest priority.  An entry without a cookie is treated as
priority `B'.  Priorities make a difference only in the agenda (*note
Weekly/daily agenda::); outside the agenda, they have no inherent
meaning to Org mode.

   Priorities can be attached to any outline tree entries; they do not
need to be TODO items.

`C-c ,'
     Set the priority of the current headline.  The command prompts for
     a priority character `A', `B' or `C'.  When you press <SPC>
     instead, the priority cookie is removed from the headline.  The
     priorities can also be changed "remotely" from the timeline and
     agenda buffer with the `,' command (*note Agenda commands::).  

`S-<up>'
`S-<down>'
     Increase/decrease priority of current headline(1).  Note that
     these keys are also used to modify timestamps (*note Creating
     timestamps::).  See also *note Conflicts::, for a discussion of
     the interaction with `shift-selection-mode'.

   You can change the range of allowed priorities by setting the
variables `org-highest-priority', `org-lowest-priority', and
`org-default-priority'.  For an individual buffer, you may set these
values (highest, lowest, default) like this (please make sure that the
highest priority is earlier in the alphabet than the lowest priority):

     #+PRIORITIES: A C B

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) See also the option `org-priority-start-cycle-with-default'.


File: org,  Node: Breaking down tasks,  Next: Checkboxes,  Prev: Priorities,  Up: TODO Items

5.5 Breaking tasks down into subtasks
=====================================

It is often advisable to break down large tasks into smaller, manageable
subtasks.  You can do this by creating an outline tree below a TODO
item, with detailed subtasks on the tree(1).  To keep the overview over
the fraction of subtasks that are already completed, insert either
`[/]' or `[%]' anywhere in the headline.  These cookies will be updates
each time the todo status of a child changes, or when pressing `C-c
C-c' on the cookie.  For example:

     * Organize Party [33%]
     ** TODO Call people [1/2]
     *** TODO Peter
     *** DONE Sarah
     ** TODO Buy food
     ** DONE Talk to neighbor

   If a heading has both checkboxes and TODO children below it, the
meaning of the statistics cookie become ambiguous.  Set the property
`COOKIE_DATA' to either `checkbox' or `todo' to resolve this issue.

   If you would like to have the statistics cookie count any TODO
entries in the subtree (not just direct children), configure the
variable `org-hierarchical-todo-statistics'.  To do this for a single
subtree, include the word `recursive' into the value of the
`COOKIE_DATA' property.

     * Parent capturing statistics [2/20]
       :PROPERTIES:
       :COOKIE_DATA: todo recursive
       :END:

   If you would like a TODO entry to automatically change to DONE when
all children are done, you can use the following setup:

     (defun org-summary-todo (n-done n-not-done)
       "Switch entry to DONE when all subentries are done, to TODO otherwise."
       (let (org-log-done org-log-states)   ; turn off logging
         (org-todo (if (= n-not-done 0) "DONE" "TODO"))))

     (add-hook 'org-after-todo-statistics-hook 'org-summary-todo)

   Another possibility is the use of checkboxes to identify (a
hierarchy of) a large number of subtasks (*note Checkboxes::).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) To keep subtasks out of the global TODO list, see the
`org-agenda-todo-list-sublevels'.


File: org,  Node: Checkboxes,  Prev: Breaking down tasks,  Up: TODO Items

5.6 Checkboxes
==============

Every item in a plain list (*note Plain lists::) can be made into a
checkbox by starting it with the string `[ ]'.  This feature is similar
to TODO items (*note TODO Items::), but is more lightweight.
Checkboxes are not included into the global TODO list, so they are often
great to split a task into a number of simple steps.  Or you can use
them in a shopping list.  To toggle a checkbox, use `C-c C-c', or use
the mouse (thanks to Piotr Zielinski's `org-mouse.el').

   Here is an example of a checkbox list.

     * TODO Organize party [2/4]
       - [-] call people [1/3]
         - [ ] Peter
         - [X] Sarah
         - [ ] Sam
       - [X] order food

   Checkboxes work hierarchically, so if a checkbox item has children
that are checkboxes, toggling one of the children checkboxes will make
the parent checkbox reflect if none, some, or all of the children are
checked.

   The `[2/4]' and `[1/3]' in the first and second line are cookies
indicating how many checkboxes present in this entry have been checked
off, and the total number of checkboxes present.  This can give you an
idea on how many checkboxes remain, even without opening a folded
entry.  The cookies can be placed into a headline or into (the first
line of) a plain list item.  Each cookie covers checkboxes of direct
children structurally below the headline/item on which the cookie
appears(1).  You have to insert the cookie yourself by typing either
`[/]' or `[%]'.  With `[/]' you get an `n out of m' result, as in the
examples above.  With `[%]' you get information about the percentage of
checkboxes checked (in the above example, this would be `[50%]' and
`[33%]', respectively).  In a headline, a cookie can count either
checkboxes below the heading or TODO states of children, and it will
display whatever was changed last.  Set the property `COOKIE_DATA' to
either `checkbox' or `todo' to resolve this issue.

   If the current outline node has an `ORDERED' property, checkboxes
must be checked off in sequence, and an error will be thrown if you try
to check off a box while there are unchecked boxes above it.

The following commands work with checkboxes:

`C-c C-c'
     Toggle checkbox status or (with prefix arg) checkbox presence at
     point.  With double prefix argument, set it to `[-]', which is
     considered to be an intermediate state.  

`C-c C-x C-b'
     Toggle checkbox status or (with prefix arg) checkbox presence at
     point.  With double prefix argument, set it to `[-]', which is
     considered to be an intermediate state.
        - If there is an active region, toggle the first checkbox in
          the region and set all remaining boxes to the same status as
          the first.  With a prefix arg, add or remove the checkbox for
          all items in the region.

        - If the cursor is in a headline, toggle checkboxes in the
          region between this headline and the next (so _not_ the
          entire subtree).

        - If there is no active region, just toggle the checkbox at
          point.
     
`M-S-<RET>'
     Insert a new item with a checkbox.  This works only if the cursor
     is already in a plain list item (*note Plain lists::).  

`C-c C-x o'
     Toggle the `ORDERED' property of the entry, to toggle if
     checkboxes must be checked off in sequence.  A property is used
     for this behavior because this should be local to the current
     entry, not inherited like a tag.  However, if you would like to
     track the value of this property with a tag for better visibility,
     customize the variable `org-track-ordered-property-with-tag'.  

`C-c #'
     Update the statistics cookie in the current outline entry.  When
     called with a `C-u' prefix, update the entire file.  Checkbox
     statistic cookies are updated automatically if you toggle
     checkboxes with `C-c C-c' and make new ones with `M-S-<RET>'.
     TODO statistics cookies update when changing TODO states.  If you
     delete boxes/entries or add/change them by hand, use this command
     to get things back into sync.  Or simply toggle any entry twice
     (checkboxes with `C-c C-c').

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Set the variable `org-hierarchical-checkbox-statistics' if you
want such cookies to represent the all checkboxes below the cookie, not
just the direct children.

6 Tags
******

An excellent way to implement labels and contexts for cross-correlating
information is to assign tags to headlines.  Org mode has extensive
support for tags.

   Every headline can contain a list of tags; they occur at the end of
the headline.  Tags are normal words containing letters, numbers, `_',
and `@'.  Tags must be preceded and followed by a single colon, e.g.,
`:work:'.  Several tags can be specified, as in `:work:urgent:'.  Tags
will by default be in bold face with the same color as the headline.
You may specify special faces for specific tags using the variable
`org-tag-faces', in much the same way as you can for TODO keywords
(*note Faces for TODO keywords::).

File: org,  Node: Tag inheritance,  Next: Setting tags,  Prev: Tags,  Up: Tags

6.1 Tag inheritance
===================

Tags make use of the hierarchical structure of outline trees.  If a
heading has a certain tag, all subheadings will inherit the tag as
well.  For example, in the list

     * Meeting with the French group      :work:
     ** Summary by Frank                  :boss:notes:
     *** TODO Prepare slides for him      :action:

the final heading will have the tags `:work:', `:boss:', `:notes:', and
`:action:' even though the final heading is not explicitly marked with
those tags.  You can also set tags that all entries in a file should
inherit just as if these tags were defined in a hypothetical level zero
that surrounds the entire file.  Use a line like this(1):

     #+FILETAGS: :Peter:Boss:Secret:

To limit tag inheritance to specific tags, or to turn it off entirely,
use the variables `org-use-tag-inheritance' and
`org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance'.

   When a headline matches during a tags search while tag inheritance
is turned on, all the sublevels in the same tree will (for a simple
match form) match as well(2).  The list of matches may then become very
long.  If you only want to see the first tags match in a subtree,
configure the variable `org-tags-match-list-sublevels' (not
recommended).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) As with all these in-buffer settings, pressing `C-c C-c'
activates any changes in the line.

   (2) This is only true if the search does not involve more complex
tests including properties (*note Property searches::).


File: org,  Node: Setting tags,  Next: Tag searches,  Prev: Tag inheritance,  Up: Tags

6.2 Setting tags
================

Tags can simply be typed into the buffer at the end of a headline.
After a colon, `M-<TAB>' offers completion on tags.  There is also a
special command for inserting tags:

`C-c C-q'
     Enter new tags for the current headline.  Org mode will either
     offer completion or a special single-key interface for setting
     tags, see below.  After pressing <RET>, the tags will be inserted
     and aligned to `org-tags-column'.  When called with a `C-u'
     prefix, all tags in the current buffer will be aligned to that
     column, just to make things look nice.  TAGS are automatically
     realigned after promotion, demotion, and TODO state changes (*note
     TODO basics::).  

`C-c C-c'
     When the cursor is in a headline, this does the same as `C-c C-q'.

   Org will support tag insertion based on a _list of tags_.  By
default this list is constructed dynamically, containing all tags
currently used in the buffer.  You may also globally specify a hard list
of tags with the variable `org-tag-alist'.  Finally you can set the
default tags for a given file with lines like

     #+TAGS: @work @home @tennisclub
     #+TAGS: laptop car pc sailboat

   If you have globally defined your preferred set of tags using the
variable `org-tag-alist', but would like to use a dynamic tag list in a
specific file, add an empty TAGS option line to that file:

     #+TAGS:

   If you have a preferred set of tags that you would like to use in
every file, in addition to those defined on a per-file basis by TAGS
option lines, then you may specify a list of tags with the variable
`org-tag-persistent-alist'.  You may turn this off on a per-file basis
by adding a STARTUP option line to that file:

     #+STARTUP: noptag

   By default Org mode uses the standard minibuffer completion
facilities for entering tags.  However, it also implements another,
quicker, tag selection method called _fast tag selection_.  This allows
you to select and deselect tags with just a single key press.  For this
to work well you should assign unique letters to most of your commonly
used tags.  You can do this globally by configuring the variable
`org-tag-alist' in your `.emacs' file.  For example, you may find the
need to tag many items in different files with `:@home:'.  In this case
you can set something like:

     (setq org-tag-alist '(("@work" . ?w) ("@home" . ?h) ("laptop" . ?l)))

If the tag is only relevant to the file you are working on, then you
can instead set the TAGS option line as:

     #+TAGS: @work(w)  @home(h)  @tennisclub(t)  laptop(l)  pc(p)

The tags interface will show the available tags in a splash window.  If
you want to start a new line after a specific tag, insert `\n' into the
tag list

     #+TAGS: @work(w)  @home(h)  @tennisclub(t) \n laptop(l)  pc(p)

or write them in two lines:

     #+TAGS: @work(w)  @home(h)  @tennisclub(t)
     #+TAGS: laptop(l)  pc(p)

You can also group together tags that are mutually exclusive by using
braces, as in:

     #+TAGS: { @work(w)  @home(h)  @tennisclub(t) }  laptop(l)  pc(p)

you indicate that at most one of `@work', `@home', and `@tennisclub'
should be selected.  Multiple such groups are allowed.

Don't forget to press `C-c C-c' with the cursor in one of these lines
to activate any changes.

To set these mutually exclusive groups in the variable `org-tags-alist',
you must use the dummy tags `:startgroup' and `:endgroup' instead of
the braces.  Similarly, you can use `:newline' to indicate a line
break.  The previous example would be set globally by the following
configuration:

     (setq org-tag-alist '((:startgroup . nil)
                           ("@work" . ?w) ("@home" . ?h)
                           ("@tennisclub" . ?t)
                           (:endgroup . nil)
                           ("laptop" . ?l) ("pc" . ?p)))

   If at least one tag has a selection key then pressing `C-c C-c' will
automatically present you with a special interface, listing inherited
tags, the tags of the current headline, and a list of all valid tags
with corresponding keys(1).  In this interface, you can use the
following keys:

`a-z...'
     Pressing keys assigned to tags will add or remove them from the
     list of tags in the current line.  Selecting a tag in a group of
     mutually exclusive tags will turn off any other tags from that
     group.  

`<TAB>'
     Enter a tag in the minibuffer, even if the tag is not in the
     predefined list.  You will be able to complete on all tags present
     in the buffer.  

`<SPC>'
     Clear all tags for this line.  

`<RET>'
     Accept the modified set.

`C-g'
     Abort without installing changes.

`q'
     If `q' is not assigned to a tag, it aborts like `C-g'.

`!'
     Turn off groups of mutually exclusive tags.  Use this to (as an
     exception) assign several tags from such a group.

`C-c'
     Toggle auto-exit after the next change (see below).  If you are
     using expert mode, the first `C-c' will display the selection
     window.

This method lets you assign tags to a headline with very few keys.  With
the above setup, you could clear the current tags and set `@home',
`laptop' and `pc' tags with just the following keys: `C-c C-c <SPC> h l
p <RET>'.  Switching from `@home' to `@work' would be done with `C-c
C-c w <RET>' or alternatively with `C-c C-c C-c w'.  Adding the
non-predefined tag `Sarah' could be done with `C-c C-c <TAB> S a r a h
<RET> <RET>'.

   If you find that most of the time you need only a single key press to
modify your list of tags, set the variable
`org-fast-tag-selection-single-key'.  Then you no longer have to press
<RET> to exit fast tag selection--it will immediately exit after the
first change.  If you then occasionally need more keys, press `C-c' to
turn off auto-exit for the current tag selection process (in effect:
start selection with `C-c C-c C-c' instead of `C-c C-c').  If you set
the variable to the value `expert', the special window is not even
shown for single-key tag selection, it comes up only when you press an
extra `C-c'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Keys will automatically be assigned to tags which have no
configured keys.

6.3 Tag searches
================

Once a system of tags has been set up, it can be used to collect related
information into special lists.

`C-c \'
`C-c / m'
     Create a sparse tree with all headlines matching a tags search.
     With a `C-u' prefix argument, ignore headlines that are not a TODO
     line.  

`C-c a m'
     Create a global list of tag matches from all agenda files.  *Note
     Matching tags and properties::.  

`C-c a M'
     Create a global list of tag matches from all agenda files, but
     check only TODO items and force checking subitems (see variable
     `org-tags-match-list-sublevels').

   These commands all prompt for a match string which allows basic
Boolean logic like `+boss+urgent-project1', to find entries with tags
`boss' and `urgent', but not `project1', or `Kathy|Sally' to find
entries which are tagged, like `Kathy' or `Sally'.  The full syntax of
the search string is rich and allows also matching against TODO
keywords, entry levels and properties.  For a complete description with
many examples, see *note Matching tags and properties::.

7 Properties and Columns
************************

Properties are a set of key-value pairs associated with an entry.  There
are two main applications for properties in Org mode.  First, properties
are like tags, but with a value.  Second, you can use properties to
implement (very basic) database capabilities in an Org buffer.  For an
example of the first application, imagine maintaining a file where you
document bugs and plan releases for a piece of software.  Instead of
using tags like `:release_1:', `:release_2:', one can use a property,
say `:Release:', that in different subtrees has different values, such
as `1.0' or `2.0'.  For an example of the second application of
properties, imagine keeping track of your music CDs, where properties
could be things such as the album, artist, date of release, number of
tracks, and so on.

   Properties can be conveniently edited and viewed in column view
(*note Column view::).

File: org,  Node: Property syntax,  Next: Special properties,  Prev: Properties and Columns,  Up: Properties and Columns

7.1 Property syntax
===================

Properties are key-value pairs.  They need to be inserted into a special
drawer (*note Drawers::) with the name `PROPERTIES'.  Each property is
specified on a single line, with the key (surrounded by colons) first,
and the value after it.  Here is an example:

     * CD collection
     ** Classic
     *** Goldberg Variations
         :PROPERTIES:
         :Title:     Goldberg Variations
         :Composer:  J.S. Bach
         :Artist:    Glen Gould
         :Publisher: Deutsche Grammophon
         :NDisks:    1
         :END:

   You may define the allowed values for a particular property `:Xyz:'
by setting a property `:Xyz_ALL:'.  This special property is
_inherited_, so if you set it in a level 1 entry, it will apply to the
entire tree.  When allowed values are defined, setting the
corresponding property becomes easier and is less prone to typing
errors.  For the example with the CD collection, we can predefine
publishers and the number of disks in a box like this:

     * CD collection
       :PROPERTIES:
       :NDisks_ALL:  1 2 3 4
       :Publisher_ALL: "Deutsche Grammophon" Philips EMI
       :END:

   If you want to set properties that can be inherited by any entry in a
file, use a line like 
     #+PROPERTY: NDisks_ALL 1 2 3 4

   Property values set with the global variable `org-global-properties'
can be inherited by all entries in all Org files.

The following commands help to work with properties:

`M-<TAB>'
     After an initial colon in a line, complete property keys.  All
     keys used in the current file will be offered as possible
     completions.  

`C-c C-x p'
     Set a property.  This prompts for a property name and a value.  If
     necessary, the property drawer is created as well.

`M-x org-insert-property-drawer'
     Insert a property drawer into the current entry.  The drawer will
     be inserted early in the entry, but after the lines with planning
     information like deadlines.  

`C-c C-c'
     With the cursor in a property drawer, this executes property
     commands.

`C-c C-c s'
     Set a property in the current entry.  Both the property and the
     value can be inserted using completion.  

`S-<left>/<right>'
     Switch property at point to the next/previous allowed value.

`C-c C-c d'
     Remove a property from the current entry.

`C-c C-c D'
     Globally remove a property, from all entries in the current file.

`C-c C-c c'
     Compute the property at point, using the operator and scope from
     the nearest column format definition.


File: org,  Node: Special properties,  Next: Property searches,  Prev: Property syntax,  Up: Properties and Columns

7.2 Special properties
======================

Special properties provide an alternative access method to Org mode
features, like the TODO state or the priority of an entry, discussed in
the previous chapters.  This interface exists so that you can include
these states in a column view (*note Column view::), or to use them in
queries.  The following property names are special and should not be
used as keys in the properties drawer:

     TODO         The TODO keyword of the entry.
     TAGS         The tags defined directly in the headline.
     ALLTAGS      All tags, including inherited ones.
     CATEGORY     The category of an entry.
     PRIORITY     The priority of the entry, a string with a single letter.
     DEADLINE     The deadline time string, without the angular brackets.
     SCHEDULED    The scheduling timestamp, without the angular brackets.
     CLOSED       When was this entry closed?
     TIMESTAMP    The first keyword-less timestamp in the entry.
     TIMESTAMP_IA The first inactive timestamp in the entry.
     CLOCKSUM     The sum of CLOCK intervals in the subtree.  `org-clock-sum'
                  must be run first to compute the values.
     ITEM         The content of the entry.


File: org,  Node: Property searches,  Next: Property inheritance,  Prev: Special properties,  Up: Properties and Columns

7.3 Property searches
=====================

To create sparse trees and special lists with selection based on
properties, the same commands are used as for tag searches (*note Tag
searches::).
`C-c \'
`C-c / m'
     Create a sparse tree with all matching entries.  With a `C-u'
     prefix argument, ignore headlines that are not a TODO line.  

`C-c a m'
     Create a global list of tag/property  matches from all agenda
     files.  *Note Matching tags and properties::.  

`C-c a M'
     Create a global list of tag matches from all agenda files, but
     check only TODO items and force checking of subitems (see variable
     `org-tags-match-list-sublevels').

   The syntax for the search string is described in *note Matching tags
and properties::.

   There is also a special command for creating sparse trees based on a
single property:

`C-c / p'
     Create a sparse tree based on the value of a property.  This first
     prompts for the name of a property, and then for a value.  A
     sparse tree is created with all entries that define this property
     with the given value.  If you enclose the value into curly braces,
     it is interpreted as a regular expression and matched against the
     property values.


File: org,  Node: Property inheritance,  Next: Column view,  Prev: Property searches,  Up: Properties and Columns

7.4 Property Inheritance
========================

The outline structure of Org-mode documents lends itself for an
inheritance model of properties: if the parent in a tree has a certain
property, the children can inherit this property.  Org mode does not
turn this on by default, because it can slow down property searches
significantly and is often not needed.  However, if you find inheritance
useful, you can turn it on by setting the variable
`org-use-property-inheritance'.  It may be set to `t' to make all
properties inherited from the parent, to a list of properties that
should be inherited, or to a regular expression that matches inherited
properties.

   Org mode has a few properties for which inheritance is hard-coded, at
least for the special applications for which they are used:

`COLUMNS'
     The `:COLUMNS:' property defines the format of column view (*note
     Column view::).  It is inherited in the sense that the level where
     a `:COLUMNS:' property is defined is used as the starting point
     for a column view table, independently of the location in the
     subtree from where columns view is turned on.

`CATEGORY'
     For agenda view, a category set through a `:CATEGORY:' property
     applies to the entire subtree.

`ARCHIVE'
     For archiving, the `:ARCHIVE:' property may define the archive
     location for the entire subtree (*note Moving subtrees::).

`LOGGING'
     The LOGGING property may define logging settings for an entry or a
     subtree (*note Tracking TODO state changes::).


File: org,  Node: Column view,  Next: Property API,  Prev: Property inheritance,  Up: Properties and Columns

7.5 Column view
===============

A great way to view and edit properties in an outline tree is _column
view_.  In column view, each outline node is turned into a table row.
Columns in this table provide access to properties of the entries.  Org
mode implements columns by overlaying a tabular structure over the
headline of each item.  While the headlines have been turned into a
table row, you can still change the visibility of the outline tree.
For example, you get a compact table by switching to CONTENTS view
(`S-<TAB> S-<TAB>', or simply `c' while column view is active), but you
can still open, read, and edit the entry below each headline.  Or, you
can switch to column view after executing a sparse tree command and in
this way get a table only for the selected items.  Column view also
works in agenda buffers (*note Agenda Views::) where queries have
collected selected items, possibly from a number of files.

7.5.1 Defining columns
----------------------

Setting up a column view first requires defining the columns.  This is
done by defining a column format line.

* Menu:

* Scope of column definitions::  Where defined, where valid?
* Column attributes::           Appearance and content of a column


File: org,  Node: Scope of column definitions,  Next: Column attributes,  Prev: Defining columns,  Up: Defining columns

7.5.1.1 Scope of column definitions
...................................

To define a column format for an entire file, use a line like

     #+COLUMNS: %25ITEM %TAGS %PRIORITY %TODO

   To specify a format that only applies to a specific tree, add a
`:COLUMNS:' property to the top node of that tree, for example:

     ** Top node for columns view
        :PROPERTIES:
        :COLUMNS: %25ITEM %TAGS %PRIORITY %TODO
        :END:

   If a `:COLUMNS:' property is present in an entry, it defines columns
for the entry itself, and for the entire subtree below it.  Since the
column definition is part of the hierarchical structure of the document,
you can define columns on level 1 that are general enough for all
sublevels, and more specific columns further down, when you edit a
deeper part of the tree.


File: org,  Node: Column attributes,  Prev: Scope of column definitions,  Up: Defining columns

7.5.1.2 Column attributes
.........................

A column definition sets the attributes of a column.  The general
definition looks like this:

      %[WIDTH]PROPERTY[(TITLE)][{SUMMARY-TYPE}]

Except for the percent sign and the property name, all items are
optional.  The individual parts have the following meaning:

     WIDTH           An integer specifying the width of the column in characters.
                     If omitted, the width will be determined automatically.
     PROPERTY        The property that should be edited in this column.
                     Special properties representing meta data are allowed here
                     as well (*note Special properties::)
     (title)         The header text for the column. If omitted, the
                     property name is used.
     {SUMMARY-TYPE}  The summary type.  If specified, the column values for
                     parent nodes are computed from the children.
                     Supported summary types are:
                     {+}       Sum numbers in this column.
                     {+;%.1f}  Like `+', but format result with `%.1f'.
                     {$}       Currency, short for `+;%.2f'.
                     {:}       Sum times, HH:MM:SS, plain numbers are hours.
                     {X}       Checkbox status, `[X]' if all children are `[X]'.
                     {X/}      Checkbox status, `[n/m]'.
                     {X%}      Checkbox status, `[n%]'.
                     {min}     Smallest number in column.
                     {max}     Largest number.
                     {mean}    Arithmetic mean of numbers.
                     {:min}    Smallest time value in column.
                     {:max}    Largest time value.
                     {:mean}   Arithmetic mean of time values.
                     {@min}   Minimum age (in days/hours/mins/seconds).
                     {@max}   Maximum age (in days/hours/mins/seconds).
                     {@mean}  Arithmetic mean of ages (in days/hours/mins/seconds).

Be aware that you can only have one summary type for any property you
include. Subsequent columns referencing the same property will all
display the same summary information.

   Here is an example for a complete columns definition, along with
allowed values.

     :COLUMNS:  %25ITEM %9Approved(Approved?){X} %Owner %11Status \(1)
     		   %10Time_Estimate{:} %CLOCKSUM
     :Owner_ALL:    Tammy Mark Karl Lisa Don
     :Status_ALL:   "In progress" "Not started yet" "Finished" ""
     :Approved_ALL: "[ ]" "[X]"

The first column, `%25ITEM', means the first 25 characters of the item
itself, i.e. of the headline.  You probably always should start the
column definition with the `ITEM' specifier.  The other specifiers
create columns `Owner' with a list of names as allowed values, for
`Status' with four different possible values, and for a checkbox field
`Approved'.  When no width is given after the `%' character, the column
will be exactly as wide as it needs to be in order to fully display all
values.  The `Approved' column does have a modified title (`Approved?',
with a question mark).  Summaries will be created for the
`Time_Estimate' column by adding time duration expressions like HH:MM,
and for the `Approved' column, by providing an `[X]' status if all
children have been checked.  The `CLOCKSUM' column is special, it lists
the sum of CLOCK intervals in the subtree.

   (1) Please note that the COLUMNS definition must be on a single
line--it is wrapped here only because of formatting constraints.

7.5.2 Using column view
-----------------------

Turning column view on and off
..............................

`C-c C-x C-c'
     Turn on column view.  If the cursor is before the first headline
     in the file, column view is turned on for the entire file, using
     the `#+COLUMNS' definition.  If the cursor is somewhere inside the
     outline, this command searches the hierarchy, up from point, for a
     `:COLUMNS:' property that defines a format.  When one is found,
     the column view table is established for the tree starting at the
     entry that contains the `:COLUMNS:' property.  If no such property
     is found, the format is taken from the `#+COLUMNS' line or from
     the variable `org-columns-default-format', and column view is
     established for the current entry and its subtree.  

`r'
     Recreate the column view, to include recent changes made in the
     buffer.  

`g'
     Same as `r'.  

`q'
     Exit column view.

Editing values
..............

`<left> <right> <up> <down>'
     Move through the column view from field to field.  

`S-<left>/<right>'
     Switch to the next/previous allowed value of the field.  For this,
     you have to have specified allowed values for a property.

`1..9,0'
     Directly select the nth allowed value, `0' selects the 10th value.  

`n / p'
     Same as `S-<left>/<right>' 

`e'
     Edit the property at point.  For the special properties, this will
     invoke the same interface that you normally use to change that
     property.  For example, when editing a TAGS property, the tag
     completion or fast selection interface will pop up.  

`C-c C-c'
     When there is a checkbox at point, toggle it.  

`v'
     View the full value of this property.  This is useful if the width
     of the column is smaller than that of the value.  

`a'
     Edit the list of allowed values for this property.  If the list is
     found in the hierarchy, the modified values is stored there.  If
     no list is found, the new value is stored in the first entry that
     is part of the current column view.

Modifying the table structure
.............................

`< / >'
     Make the column narrower/wider by one character.  

`S-M-<right>'
     Insert a new column, to the left of the current column.  

`S-M-<left>'
     Delete the current column.


File: org,  Node: Capturing column view,  Prev: Using column view,  Up: Column view

7.5.3 Capturing column view
---------------------------

Since column view is just an overlay over a buffer, it cannot be
exported or printed directly.  If you want to capture a column view, use
a `columnview' dynamic block (*note Dynamic blocks::).  The frame of
this block looks like this:

     * The column view
     #+BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id "label"

     #+END:

This dynamic block has the following parameters:

`:id'
     This is the most important parameter.  Column view is a feature
     that is often localized to a certain (sub)tree, and the capture
     block might be at a different location in the file.  To identify
     the tree whose view to capture, you can use 4 values: 
          local     use the tree in which the capture block is located
          global    make a global view, including all headings in the file
          "file:PATH-TO-FILE"
                    run column view at the top of this file
          "ID"      call column view in the tree that has an `:ID:'
                    property with the value label.  You can use
                    `M-x org-id-copy' to create a globally unique ID for
                    the current entry and copy it to the kill-ring.

`:hlines'
     When `t', insert an hline after every line.  When a number N,
     insert an hline before each headline with level `<= N'.

`:vlines'
     When set to `t', force column groups to get vertical lines.

`:maxlevel'
     When set to a number, don't capture entries below this level.

`:skip-empty-rows'
     When set to `t', skip rows where the only non-empty specifier of
     the column view is `ITEM'.


The following commands insert or update the dynamic block:

`C-c C-x i'
     Insert a dynamic block capturing a column view.  You will be
     prompted for the scope or ID of the view.  

`C-c C-c'
`C-c C-x C-u'
     Update dynamic block at point.  The cursor needs to be in the
     `#+BEGIN' line of the dynamic block.  

`C-u C-c C-x C-u'
     Update all dynamic blocks (*note Dynamic blocks::).  This is
     useful if you have several clock table blocks in a buffer.

   You can add formulas to the column view table and you may add
plotting instructions in front of the table--these will survive an
update of the block.  If there is a `#+TBLFM:' after the table, the
table will actually be recalculated automatically after an update.

   An alternative way to capture and process property values into a
table is provided by Eric Schulte's `org-collector.el' which is a
contributed package(1).  It provides a general API to collect
properties from entries in a certain scope, and arbitrary Lisp
expressions to process these values before inserting them into a table
or a dynamic block.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Contributed packages are not part of Emacs, but are distributed
with the main distribution of Org (visit `http://orgmode.org').

7.6 The Property API

There is a full API for accessing and changing properties.  This API can
be used by Emacs Lisp programs to work with properties and to implement

8 Dates and Times
*****************

To assist project planning, TODO items can be labeled with a date and/or
a time.  The specially formatted string carrying the date and time
information is called a _timestamp_ in Org mode.  This may be a little
confusing because timestamp is often used as indicating when something
was created or last changed.  However, in Org mode this term is used in
a much wider sense.

File: org,  Node: Timestamps,  Next: Creating timestamps,  Prev: Dates and Times,  Up: Dates and Times

8.1 Timestamps, deadlines, and scheduling
=========================================

A timestamp is a specification of a date (possibly with a time or a
range of times) in a special format, either `<2003-09-16 Tue>' or
`<2003-09-16 Tue 09:39>' or `<2003-09-16 Tue 12:00-12:30>'(1).  A
timestamp can appear anywhere in the headline or body of an Org tree
entry.  Its presence causes entries to be shown on specific dates in
the agenda (*note Weekly/daily agenda::).  We distinguish:

PLAIN TIMESTAMP; EVENT; APPOINTMENT
     A simple timestamp just assigns a date/time to an item.  This is
     just like writing down an appointment or event in a paper agenda.
     In the timeline and agenda displays, the headline of an entry
     associated with a plain timestamp will be shown exactly on that
     date.

          * Meet Peter at the movies <2006-11-01 Wed 19:15>
          * Discussion on climate change <2006-11-02 Thu 20:00-22:00>

TIMESTAMP WITH REPEATER INTERVAL
     A timestamp may contain a _repeater interval_, indicating that it
     applies not only on the given date, but again and again after a
     certain interval of N days (d), weeks (w), months (m), or years
     (y).  The following will show up in the agenda every Wednesday:

          * Pick up Sam at school <2007-05-16 Wed 12:30 +1w>

DIARY-STYLE SEXP ENTRIES
     For more complex date specifications, Org mode supports using the
     special sexp diary entries implemented in the Emacs calendar/diary
     package.  For example

          * The nerd meeting on every 2nd Thursday of the month
            <%%(diary-float t 4 2)>

TIME/DATE RANGE
     Two timestamps connected by `--' denote a range.  The headline
     will be shown on the first and last day of the range, and on any
     dates that are displayed and fall in the range.  Here is an
     example:

          ** Meeting in Amsterdam
             <2004-08-23 Mon>--<2004-08-26 Thu>

INACTIVE TIMESTAMP
     Just like a plain timestamp, but with square brackets instead of
     angular ones.  These timestamps are inactive in the sense that
     they do _not_ trigger an entry to show up in the agenda.

          * Gillian comes late for the fifth time [2006-11-01 Wed]


   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This is inspired by the standard ISO 6801 date/time format.  To
use an alternative format, see *note Custom time format::.

8.2 Creating timestamps
=======================

For Org mode to recognize timestamps, they need to be in the specific
format.  All commands listed below produce timestamps in the correct
format.

`C-c .'
     Prompt for a date and insert a corresponding timestamp.  When the
     cursor is at an existing timestamp in the buffer, the command is
     used to modify this timestamp instead of inserting a new one.
     When this command is used twice in succession, a time range is
     inserted.  

`C-c !'
     Like `C-c .', but insert an inactive timestamp that will not cause
     an agenda entry.  

`C-u C-c .'
`C-u C-c !'
     Like `C-c .' and `C-c !', but use the alternative format which
     contains date and time.  The default time can be rounded to
     multiples of 5 minutes, see the option
     `org-time-stamp-rounding-minutes'.  

`C-c <'
     Insert a timestamp corresponding to the cursor date in the
     Calendar.  

`C-c >'
     Access the Emacs calendar for the current date.  If there is a
     timestamp in the current line, go to the corresponding date
     instead.  

`C-c C-o'
     Access the agenda for the date given by the timestamp or -range at
     point (*note Weekly/daily agenda::).  

`S-<left>'
`S-<right>'
     Change date at cursor by one day.  These key bindings conflict with
     shift-selection and related modes (*note Conflicts::).  

`S-<up>'
`S-<down>'
     Change the item under the cursor in a timestamp.  The cursor can
     be on a year, month, day, hour or minute.  When the timestamp
     contains a time range like `15:30-16:30', modifying the first time
     will also shift the second, shifting the time block with constant
     length.  To change the length, modify the second time.  Note that
     if the cursor is in a headline and not at a timestamp, these same
     keys modify the priority of an item.  (*note Priorities::). The
     key bindings also conflict with shift-selection and related modes
     (*note Conflicts::).  

`C-c C-y'
     Evaluate a time range by computing the difference between start
     and end.  With a prefix argument, insert result after the time
     range (in a table: into the following column).

* The date/time prompt::        How Org mode helps you entering date and time

File: org,  Node: The date/time prompt,  Next: Custom time format,  Prev: Creating timestamps,  Up: Creating timestamps

8.2.1 The date/time prompt
--------------------------

When Org mode prompts for a date/time, the default is shown in default
date/time format, and the prompt therefore seems to ask for a specific
format.  But it will in fact accept any string containing some date
and/or time information, and it is really smart about interpreting your
input.  You can, for example, use `C-y' to paste a (possibly
multi-line) string copied from an email message.  Org mode will find
whatever information is in there and derive anything you have not
specified from the _default date and time_.  The default is usually the
current date and time, but when modifying an existing timestamp, or
when entering the second stamp of a range, it is taken from the stamp
in the buffer.  When filling in information, Org mode assumes that most
of the time you will want to enter a date in the future: if you omit
the month/year and the given day/month is before today, it will assume
that you mean a future date(1).  If the date has been automatically
shifted into the future, the time prompt will show this with `(=>F).'

   For example, let's assume that today is June 13, 2006.  Here is how
various inputs will be interpreted, the items filled in by Org mode are
in bold.

     3-2-5         --> 2003-02-05
     14            --> 2006-06-14
     12            --> 2006-07-12
     Fri           --> nearest Friday (defaultdate or later)
     sep 15        --> 2006-09-15
     feb 15        --> 2007-02-15
     sep 12 9      --> 2009-09-12
     12:45         --> 2006-06-13 12:45
     22 sept 0:34  --> 2006-09-22 0:34
     w4            --> ISO week for of the current year 2006
     2012 w4 fri   --> Friday of ISO week 4 in 2012
     2012-w04-5    --> Same as above

   Furthermore you can specify a relative date by giving, as the
_first_ thing in the input: a plus/minus sign, a number and a letter
([dwmy]) to indicate change in days, weeks, months, or years.  With a
single plus or minus, the date is always relative to today.  With a
double plus or minus, it is relative to the default date.  If instead of
a single letter, you use the abbreviation of day name, the date will be
the nth such day.  E.g.

     +0            --> today
     .             --> today
     +4d           --> four days from today
     +4            --> same as above
     +2w           --> two weeks from today
     ++5           --> five days from default date
     +2tue         --> second Tuesday from now.

   The function understands English month and weekday abbreviations.  If
you want to use unabbreviated names and/or other languages, configure
the variables `parse-time-months' and `parse-time-weekdays'.

   Parallel to the minibuffer prompt, a calendar is popped up(2).  When
you exit the date prompt, either by clicking on a date in the calendar,
or by pressing <RET>, the date selected in the calendar will be
combined with the information entered at the prompt.  You can control
the calendar fully from the minibuffer:

     > / <          Scroll calendar forward/backward by one month.
     mouse-1        Select date by clicking on it.
     S-<right>/<left>     One day forward/backward.
     S-<down>/<up>     One week forward/backward.
     M-S-<right>/<left>   One month forward/backward.
     <RET>           Choose date in calendar.

   The actions of the date/time prompt may seem complex, but I assure
you they will grow on you, and you will start getting annoyed by pretty
much any other way of entering a date/time out there.  To help you
understand what is going on, the current interpretation of your input
will be displayed live in the minibuffer(3).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) See the variable `org-read-date-prefer-future'.  You may set
that variable to the symbol `time' to even make a time before now shift
the date to tomorrow.

   (2) If you don't need/want the calendar, configure the variable
`org-popup-calendar-for-date-prompt'.

   (3) If you find this distracting, turn the display of with
`org-read-date-display-live'.


File: org,  Node: Custom time format,  Prev: The date/time prompt,  Up: Creating timestamps

8.2.2 Custom time format
------------------------

Org mode uses the standard ISO notation for dates and times as it is
defined in ISO 8601.  If you cannot get used to this and require another
representation of date and time to keep you happy, you can get it by
customizing the variables `org-display-custom-times' and
`org-time-stamp-custom-formats'.

`C-c C-x C-t'
     Toggle the display of custom formats for dates and times.

Org mode needs the default format for scanning, so the custom date/time
format does not _replace_ the default format--instead it is put _over_
the default format using text properties.  This has the following
consequences:
   * You cannot place the cursor onto a timestamp anymore, only before
     or after.

   * The `S-<up>/<down>' keys can no longer be used to adjust each
     component of a timestamp.  If the cursor is at the beginning of
     the stamp, `S-<up>/<down>' will change the stamp by one day, just
     like `S-<left>/<right>'.  At the end of the stamp, the time will
     be changed by one minute.

   * If the timestamp contains a range of clock times or a repeater,
     these will not be overlayed, but remain in the buffer as they were.

   * When you delete a timestamp character-by-character, it will only
     disappear from the buffer after _all_ (invisible) characters
     belonging to the ISO timestamp have been removed.

   * If the custom timestamp format is longer than the default and you
     are using dates in tables, table alignment will be messed up.  If
     the custom format is shorter, things do work as expected.

8.3 Deadlines and scheduling
============================

A timestamp may be preceded by special keywords to facilitate planning:

DEADLINE
     Meaning: the task (most likely a TODO item, though not
     necessarily) is supposed to be finished on that date.

     On the deadline date, the task will be listed in the agenda.  In
     addition, the agenda for _today_ will carry a warning about the
     approaching or missed deadline, starting
     `org-deadline-warning-days' before the due date, and continuing
     until the entry is marked DONE.  An example:

          *** TODO write article about the Earth for the Guide
              The editor in charge is [[bbdb:Ford Prefect]]
              DEADLINE: <2004-02-29 Sun>

     You can specify a different lead time for warnings for a specific
     deadlines using the following syntax.  Here is an example with a
     warning period of 5 days `DEADLINE: <2004-02-29 Sun -5d>'.

SCHEDULED
     Meaning: you are planning to start working on that task on the
     given date.

     The headline will be listed under the given date(1).  In addition,
     a reminder that the scheduled date has passed will be present in
     the compilation for _today_, until the entry is marked DONE.  I.e.
     the task will automatically be forwarded until completed.

          *** TODO Call Trillian for a date on New Years Eve.
              SCHEDULED: <2004-12-25 Sat>

     Important: Scheduling an item in Org mode should not be understood
     in the same way that we understand scheduling a meeting.  Setting
     a date for a meeting is just a simple appointment, you should mark
     this entry with a simple plain timestamp, to get this item shown
     on the date where it applies.  This is a frequent misunderstanding
     by Org users.  In Org mode, scheduling means setting a date when
     you want to start working on an action item.

   You may use timestamps with repeaters in scheduling and deadline
entries.  Org mode will issue early and late warnings based on the
assumption that the timestamp represents the nearest instance of the
repeater.  However, the use of diary sexp entries like `<%%(diary-float
t 42)>' in scheduling and deadline timestamps is limited.  Org mode
does not know enough about the internals of each sexp function to issue
early and late warnings.  However, it will show the item on each day
where the sexp entry matches.

* Menu:

* Inserting deadline/schedule::  Planning items
* Repeated tasks::              Items that show up again and again

   (1) It will still be listed on that date after it has been marked
DONE.  If you don't like this, set the variable
`org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done'.

8.3.1 Inserting deadlines or schedules
--------------------------------------

The following commands allow you to quickly insert a deadline or to
schedule an item:

`C-c C-d'
     Insert `DEADLINE' keyword along with a stamp.  The insertion will
     happen in the line directly following the headline.  When called
     with a prefix arg, an existing deadline will be removed from the
     entry.  Depending on the variable `org-log-redeadline'(1), a note
     will be taken when changing an existing deadline.  

`C-c C-s'
     Insert `SCHEDULED' keyword along with a stamp.  The insertion will
     happen in the line directly following the headline.  Any CLOSED
     timestamp will be removed.  When called with a prefix argument,
     remove the scheduling date from the entry.  Depending on the
     variable `org-log-reschedule'(2), a note will be taken when
     changing an existing scheduling time.  

`C-c C-x C-k'
     Mark the current entry for agenda action.  After you have marked
     the entry like this, you can open the agenda or the calendar to
     find an appropriate date.  With the cursor on the selected date,
     press `k s' or `k d' to schedule the marked item.  

`C-c / d'
     Create a sparse tree with all deadlines that are either past-due,
     or which will become due within `org-deadline-warning-days'.  With
     `C-u' prefix, show all deadlines in the file.  With a numeric
     prefix, check that many days.  For example, `C-1 C-c / d' shows
     all deadlines due tomorrow.  

`C-c / b'
     Sparse tree for deadlines and scheduled items before a given date.  

`C-c / a'
     Sparse tree for deadlines and scheduled items after a given date.

8.3.2 Repeated tasks
--------------------

Some tasks need to be repeated again and again.  Org mode helps to
organize such tasks using a so-called repeater in a DEADLINE, SCHEDULED,
or plain timestamp.  In the following example
     ** TODO Pay the rent
        DEADLINE: <2005-10-01 Sat +1m>
   the `+1m' is a repeater; the intended interpretation is that the task
has a deadline on <2005-10-01> and repeats itself every (one) month
starting from that time.  If you need both a repeater and a special
warning period in a deadline entry, the repeater should come first and
the warning period last: `DEADLINE: <2005-10-01 Sat +1m -3d>'.

   Deadlines and scheduled items produce entries in the agenda when they
are over-due, so it is important to be able to mark such an entry as
completed once you have done so.  When you mark a DEADLINE or a SCHEDULE
with the TODO keyword DONE, it will no longer produce entries in the
agenda.  The problem with this is, however, that then also the _next_
instance of the repeated entry will not be active.  Org mode deals with
this in the following way: When you try to mark such an entry DONE
(using `C-c C-t'), it will shift the base date of the repeating
timestamp by the repeater interval, and immediately set the entry state
back to TODO.  In the example above, setting the state to DONE would
actually switch the date like this:

     ** TODO Pay the rent
        DEADLINE: <2005-11-01 Tue +1m>

   A timestamp(1) will be added under the deadline, to keep a record
that you actually acted on the previous instance of this deadline.

   As a consequence of shifting the base date, this entry will no
longer be visible in the agenda when checking past dates, but all
future instances will be visible.

   With the `+1m' cookie, the date shift will always be exactly one
month.  So if you have not paid the rent for three months, marking this
entry DONE will still keep it as an overdue deadline.  Depending on the
task, this may not be the best way to handle it.  For example, if you
forgot to call you father for 3 weeks, it does not make sense to call
him 3 times in a single day to make up for it.  Finally, there are tasks
like changing batteries which should always repeat a certain time after
the last time you did it.  For these tasks, Org mode has special
repeaters markers with `++' and `.+'.  For example:

     ** TODO Call Father
        DEADLINE: <2008-02-10 Sun ++1w>
        Marking this DONE will shift the date by at least one week,
        but also by as many weeks as it takes to get this date into
        the future.  However, it stays on a Sunday, even if you called
        and marked it done on Saturday.
     ** TODO Check the batteries in the smoke detectors
        DEADLINE: <2005-11-01 Tue .+1m>
        Marking this DONE will shift the date to one month after
        today.

   You may have both scheduling and deadline information for a specific
task--just make sure that the repeater intervals on both are the same.

   An alternative to using a repeater is to create a number of copies
of a task subtree, with dates shifted in each copy.  The command `C-c
C-x c' was created for this purpose, it is described in *note Structure
editing::.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) You can change this using the option `org-log-repeat', or the
`#+STARTUP' options `logrepeat', `lognoterepeat', and `nologrepeat'.
With `lognoterepeat', you will also be prompted for a note.


File: org,  Node: Clocking work time,  Next: Resolving idle time,  Prev: Deadlines and scheduling,  Up: Dates and Times

8.4 Clocking work time
======================

Org mode allows you to clock the time you spend on specific tasks in a
project.  When you start working on an item, you can start the clock.
When you stop working on that task, or when you mark the task done, the
clock is stopped and the corresponding time interval is recorded.  It
also computes the total time spent on each subtree of a project.  And it
remembers a history or tasks recently clocked, to that you can jump
quickly between a number of tasks absorbing your time.

   To save the clock history across Emacs sessions, use
     (setq org-clock-persist 'history)
     (org-clock-persistence-insinuate)
   When you clock into a new task after resuming Emacs, the incomplete
clock(1) will be found (*note Resolving idle time::) and you will be
prompted about what to do with it.

`C-c C-x C-i'
     Start the clock on the current item (clock-in).  This inserts the
     CLOCK keyword together with a timestamp.  If this is not the first
     clocking of this item, the multiple CLOCK lines will be wrapped
     into a `:LOGBOOK:' drawer (see also the variable
     `org-clock-into-drawer').  When called with a `C-u' prefix
     argument, select the task from a list of recently clocked tasks.
     With two `C-u C-u' prefixes, clock into the task at point and mark
     it as the default task.  The default task will always be available
     when selecting a clocking task, with letter `d'.
     While the clock is running, the current clocking time is shown in
     the mode line, along with the title of the task.  The clock time
     shown will be all time ever clocked for this task and its
     children.  If the task has an effort estimate (*note Effort
     estimates::), the mode line displays the current clocking time
     against it(2)  If the task is a repeating one (*note Repeated
     tasks::), only the time since the last reset of the task (3) will
     be shown.  More control over what time is shown can be exercised
     with the `CLOCK_MODELINE_TOTAL' property.  It may have the values
     `current' to show only the current clocking instance, `today' to
     show all time clocked on this tasks today (see also the variable
     `org-extend-today-until'), `all' to include all time, or `auto'
     which is the default(4).
     Clicking with `mouse-1' onto the mode line entry will pop up a
     menu with clocking options.  

`C-c C-x C-o'
     Stop the clock (clock-out).  This inserts another timestamp at the
     same location where the clock was last started.  It also directly
     computes the resulting time in inserts it after the time range as
     `=> HH:MM'.  See the variable `org-log-note-clock-out' for the
     possibility to record an additional note together with the
     clock-out timestamp(5).  

`C-c C-x C-e'
     Update the effort estimate for the current clock task.  

`C-c C-y   or  C-c C-c'
     Recompute the time interval after changing one of the timestamps.
     This is only necessary if you edit the timestamps directly.  If
     you change them with `S-<cursor>' keys, the update is automatic.  

`C-c C-t'
     Changing the TODO state of an item to DONE automatically stops the
     clock if it is running in this same item.  

`C-c C-x C-x'
     Cancel the current clock.  This is useful if a clock was started by
     mistake, or if you ended up working on something else.  

`C-c C-x C-j'
     Jump to the entry that contains the currently running clock.  With
     a `C-u' prefix arg, select the target task from a list of recently
     clocked tasks.  

`C-c C-x C-d'
     Display time summaries for each subtree in the current buffer.
     This puts overlays at the end of each headline, showing the total
     time recorded under that heading, including the time of any
     subheadings. You can use visibility cycling to study the tree, but
     the overlays disappear when you change the buffer (see variable
     `org-remove-highlights-with-change') or press `C-c C-c'.  

`C-c C-x C-r'
     Insert a dynamic block (*note Dynamic blocks::) containing a clock
     report as an Org-mode table into the current file.  When the
     cursor is at an existing clock table, just update it.  When called
     with a prefix argument, jump to the first clock report in the
     current document and update it.  
          #+BEGIN: clocktable :maxlevel 2 :emphasize nil :scope file
          #+END: clocktable
     If such a block already exists at point, its content is replaced
     by the new table.  The `BEGIN' line can specify options:
          :maxlevel    Maximum level depth to which times are listed in the table.
          :emphasize   When `t', emphasize level one and level two items.
          :scope       The scope to consider.  This can be any of the following:
                       nil        the current buffer or narrowed region
                       file       the full current buffer
                       subtree    the subtree where the clocktable is located
                       treeN      the surrounding level N tree, for example `tree3'
                       tree       the surrounding level 1 tree
                       agenda     all agenda files
                       ("file"..) scan these files
                       file-with-archives    current file and its archives
                       agenda-with-archives  all agenda files, including archives
          :block       The time block to consider.  This block is specified either
                       absolute, or relative to the current time and may be any of
                       these formats:
                       2007-12-31    New year eve 2007

                       thisyear, lastyear, thisyear-N     a relative year
                       Use `S-<left>/<right>' keys to shift the time interval.
          :tstart      A time string specifying when to start considering times.
          :tend        A time string specifying when to stop considering times.
          :step        `week' or `day', to split the table into chunks.
                       To use this, `:block' or `:tstart', `:tend' are needed.
          :link        Link the item headlines in the table to their origins.
          :formula     Content of a `#+TBLFM' line to be added and evaluated.
                       As a special case, `:formula %' adds a column with % time.
                       If you do not specify a formula here, any existing formula.
                       below the clock table will survive updates and be evaluated.
          :timestamp   A timestamp for the entry, when available.  Look for SCHEDULED,
                       DEADLINE, TIMESTAMP and TIMESTAMP_IA, in this order.
     To get a clock summary of the current level 1 tree, for the current
     day, you could write
          #+BEGIN: clocktable :maxlevel 2 :block today :scope tree1 :link t
          #+END: clocktable
     and to use a specific time range you could write(6)
          #+BEGIN: clocktable :tstart "<2006-08-10 Thu 10:00>"
                              :tend "<2006-08-10 Thu 12:00>"
          #+END: clocktable
     A summary of the current subtree with % times would be
          #+BEGIN: clocktable :scope subtree :link t :formula %
          #+END: clocktable
     
`C-c C-c'
`C-c C-x C-u'
     Update dynamic block at point.  The cursor needs to be in the
     `#+BEGIN' line of the dynamic block.  

`C-u C-c C-x C-u'
     Update all dynamic blocks (*note Dynamic blocks::).  This is
     useful if you have several clock table blocks in a buffer.  

`S-<left>'
`S-<right>'
     Shift the current `:block' interval and update the table.  The
     cursor needs to be in the `#+BEGIN: clocktable' line for this
     command.  If `:block' is `today', it will be shifted to `today-1'
     etc.

   The `l' key may be used in the timeline (*note Timeline::) and in
the agenda (*note Weekly/daily agenda::) to show which tasks have been
worked on or closed during a day.

8.5 Resolving idle time
=======================

If you clock in on a work item, and then walk away from your
computer--perhaps to take a phone call--you often need to "resolve" the
time you were away by either subtracting it from the current clock, or
applying it to another one.

   By customizing the variable `org-clock-idle-time' to some integer,
such as 10 or 15, Emacs can alert you when you get back to your
computer after being idle for that many minutes(1), and ask what you
want to do with the idle time.  There will be a question waiting for
you when you get back, indicating how much idle time has passed
(constantly updated with the current amount), as well as a set of
choices to correct the discrepancy:

`k'
     To keep some or all of the minutes and stay clocked in, press `k'.
     Org will ask how many of the minutes to keep.  Press <RET> to keep
     them all, effectively changing nothing, or enter a number to keep
     that many minutes.

`K'
     If you use the shift key and press `K', it will keep however many
     minutes you request and then immediately clock out of that task.
     If you keep all of the minutes, this is the same as just clocking
     out of the current task.

`s'
     To keep none of the minutes, use `s' to subtract all the away time
     from the clock, and then check back in from the moment you
     returned.

`S'
     To keep none of the minutes and just clock out at the start of the
     away time, use the shift key and press `S'.  Remember that using
     shift will always leave you clocked out, no matter which option
     you choose.

`C'
     To cancel the clock altogether, use `C'.  Note that if instead of
     cancelling you subtract the away time, and the resulting clock
     amount is less than a minute, the clock will still be cancelled
     rather than clutter up the log with an empty entry.

   What if you subtracted those away minutes from the current clock,
and now want to apply them to a new clock?  Simply clock in to any task
immediately after the subtraction.  Org will notice that you have
subtracted time "on the books", so to speak, and will ask if you want
to apply those minutes to the next task you clock in on.

   There is one other instance when this clock resolution magic occurs.
Say you were clocked in and hacking away, and suddenly your cat chased
a mouse who scared a hamster that crashed into your UPS's power button!
You suddenly lose all your buffers, but thanks to auto-save you still
have your recent Org mode changes, including your last clock in.

   If you restart Emacs and clock into any task, Org will notice that
you have a dangling clock which was never clocked out from your last
session.  Using that clock's starting time as the beginning of the
unaccounted-for period, Org will ask how you want to resolve that time.
The logic and behavior is identical to dealing with away time due to
idleness, it's just happening due to a recovery event rather than a set
amount of idle time.

   You can also check all the files visited by your Org agenda for
dangling clocks at any time using `M-x org-resolve-clocks'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) On computers using Mac OS X, idleness is based on actual user
idleness, not just Emacs' idle time.  For X11, you can install a
utility program `x11idle.c', available in the UTILITIES directory of
the Org git distribution, to get the same general treatment of
idleness.  On other systems, idle time refers to Emacs idle time only.


File: org,  Node: Effort estimates,  Next: Relative timer,  Prev: Resolving idle time,  Up: Dates and Times

8.6 Effort estimates
====================

If you want to plan your work in a very detailed way, or if you need to
produce offers with quotations of the estimated work effort, you may
want to assign effort estimates to entries.  If you are also clocking
your work, you may later want to compare the planned effort with the
actual working time, a great way to improve planning estimates.  Effort
estimates are stored in a special property `Effort'(1).  You can set
the effort for an entry with the following commands:

`C-c C-x e'
     Set the effort estimate for the current entry.  With a numeric
     prefix argument, set it to the NTH allowed value (see below).
     This command is also accessible from the agenda with the `e' key.  

`C-c C-x C-e'
     Modify the effort estimate of the item currently being clocked.

   Clearly the best way to work with effort estimates is through column
view (*note Column view::).  You should start by setting up discrete
values for effort estimates, and a `COLUMNS' format that displays these
values together with clock sums (if you want to clock your time).  For
a specific buffer you can use

     #+PROPERTY: Effort_ALL 0 0:10 0:30 1:00 2:00 3:00 4:00 5:00 6:00 7:00 8:00
     #+COLUMNS: %40ITEM(Task) %17Effort(Estimated Effort){:} %CLOCKSUM

or, even better, you can set up these values globally by customizing the
variables `org-global-properties' and `org-columns-default-format'.  In
particular if you want to use this setup also in the agenda, a global
setup may be advised.

   The way to assign estimates to individual items is then to switch to
column mode, and to use `S-<right>' and `S-<left>' to change the value.
The values you enter will immediately be summed up in the hierarchy.
In the column next to it, any clocked time will be displayed.

   If you switch to column view in the daily/weekly agenda, the effort
column will summarize the estimated work effort for each day(2), and
you can use this to find space in your schedule.  To get an overview of
the entire part of the day that is committed, you can set the option
`org-agenda-columns-add-appointments-to-effort-sum'.  The appointments
on a day that take place over a specified time interval will then also
be added to the load estimate of the day.

   Effort estimates can be used in secondary agenda filtering that is
triggered with the `/' key in the agenda (*note Agenda commands::).  If
you have these estimates defined consistently, two or three key presses
will narrow down the list to stuff that fits into an available time
slot.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) You may change the property being used with the variable
`org-effort-property'.

   (2) Please note the pitfalls of summing hierarchical data in a flat
list (*note Agenda column view::).

8.7 Taking notes with a relative timer
======================================

When taking notes during, for example, a meeting or a video viewing, it
can be useful to have access to times relative to a starting time.  Org
provides such a relative timer and make it easy to create timed notes.

`C-c C-x .'
     Insert a relative time into the buffer.  The first time you use
     this, the timer will be started.  When called with a prefix
     argument, the timer is restarted.  

`C-c C-x -'
     Insert a description list item with the current relative time.
     With a prefix argument, first reset the timer to 0.  

`M-<RET>'
     Once the timer list is started, you can also use `M-<RET>' to
     insert new timer items.  

`C-c C-x ,'
     Pause the timer, or continue it if it is already paused.  

`C-u C-c C-x ,'
     Stop the timer.  After this, you can only start a new timer, not
     continue the old one.  This command also removes the timer from
     the mode line.  

`C-c C-x 0'
     Reset the timer without inserting anything into the buffer.  By
     default, the timer is reset to 0.  When called with a `C-u'
     prefix, reset the timer to specific starting offset.  The user is
     prompted for the offset, with a default taken from a timer string
     at point, if any, So this can be used to restart taking notes
     after a break in the process.  When called with a double prefix
     argument `C-c C-u', change all timer strings in the active region
     by a certain amount.  This can be used to fix timer strings if the
     timer was not started at exactly the right moment.

9 Capture - Refile - Archive
****************************

An important part of any organization system is the ability to quickly
capture new ideas and tasks, and to associate reference material with
them.  Org uses the `remember.el' package to create tasks, and stores
files related to a task (attachments) in a special directory.  Once in
the system, tasks and projects need to be moved around.  Moving
completed project trees to an archive file keeps the system compact and
fast.

* Menu:

* Remember::                    Capture new tasks/ideas with little interruption
* Attachments::                 Add files to tasks.

9.1 Remember
============

The Remember package by John Wiegley lets you store quick notes with
little interruption of your work flow.  It is an excellent way to add
new notes and tasks to Org files.  The `remember.el' package is part of
Emacs 23, not Emacs 22.  See
`http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/RememberMode' for more
information.

   Org significantly expands the possibilities of Remember: you may
define templates for different note types, and associate target files
and headlines with specific templates.  It also allows you to select
the location where a note should be stored interactively, on the fly.

* Menu:

* Setting up Remember for Org::  Some code for .emacs to get things going
* Remember templates::          Define the outline of different note types
* Storing notes::               Directly get the note to where it belongs


File: org,  Node: Setting up Remember for Org,  Next: Remember templates,  Prev: Remember,  Up: Remember

9.1.1 Setting up Remember for Org
---------------------------------

The following customization will tell Remember to use Org files as
target, and to create annotations compatible with Org links.

     (org-remember-insinuate)
     (setq org-directory "~/path/to/my/orgfiles/")
     (setq org-default-notes-file (concat org-directory "/notes.org"))
     (define-key global-map "\C-cr" 'org-remember)

The last line binds the command `org-remember' to a global key(1).
`org-remember' basically just calls Remember, but it makes a few things
easier: if there is an active region, it will automatically copy the
region into the Remember buffer.  It also allows to jump to the buffer
and location where Remember notes are being stored: just call
`org-remember' with a prefix argument.  If you use two prefix
arguments, Org jumps to the location where the last remember note was
stored.

   The Remember buffer will actually use `org-mode' as its major mode,
so that all editing features of Org mode are available.  In addition to
this, a minor mode `org-remember-mode' is turned on, for the single
purpose that you can use its keymap `org-remember-mode-map' to
overwrite some of Org mode's key bindings.

   You can also call `org-remember' in a special way from the agenda,
using the `k r' key combination.  With this access, any timestamps
inserted by the selected Remember template (see below) will default to
the cursor date in the agenda, rather than to the current date.

9.1.2 Remember templates
------------------------

In combination with Org, you can use templates to generate different
types of Remember notes.  For example, if you would like to use one
template to create general TODO entries, another one for journal
entries, and a third one for collecting random ideas, you could use:

     (setq org-remember-templates
      '(("Todo" ?t "* TODO %?\n  %i\n  %a" "~/org/TODO.org" "Tasks")
        ("Journal" ?j "* %U %?\n\n  %i\n  %a" "~/org/JOURNAL.org")
        ("Idea" ?i "* %^{Title}\n  %i\n  %a" "~/org/JOURNAL.org" "New Ideas")))

In these entries, the first string is just a name, and the character
specifies how to select the template.  It is useful if the character is
also the first letter of the name.  The next string specifies the
template.  Two more (optional) strings give the file in which, and the
headline under which, the new note should be stored.  The file (if not
present or `nil') defaults to `org-default-notes-file', the heading to
`org-remember-default-headline'.  If the file name is not an absolute
path, it will be interpreted relative to `org-directory'.

   The heading can also be the symbols `top' or `bottom' to send notes
as level 1 entries to the beginning or end of the file, respectively.
It may also be the symbol `date-tree'.  Then, a tree with year on level
1, month on level 2 and day on level three will be build in the file,
and the entry will be filed into the tree under the current date(1)

   An optional sixth element specifies the contexts in which the user
can select the template.  This element can be a list of major modes or
a function.  `org-remember' will first check whether the function
returns `t' or if we are in any of the listed major modes, and exclude
templates for which this condition is not fulfilled.  Templates that do
not specify this element at all, or that use `nil' or `t' as a value
will always be selectable.

   So for example:

     (setq org-remember-templates
      '(("Bug" ?b "* BUG %?\n  %i\n  %a" "~/org/BUGS.org" "Bugs" (emacs-lisp-mode))
        ("Journal" ?j "* %U %?\n\n  %i\n  %a" "~/org/JOURNAL.org" "X" my-check)
        ("Idea" ?i "* %^{Title}\n  %i\n  %a" "~/org/JOURNAL.org" "New Ideas")))

The first template will only be available when invoking `org-remember'
from an buffer in `emacs-lisp-mode'.  The second template will only be
available when the function `my-check' returns `t'.  The third template
will be proposed in any context.

   When you call `M-x org-remember' (or `M-x remember') to remember
something, Org will prompt for a key to select the template (if you have
more than one template) and then prepare the buffer like
     * TODO
       [[file:LINK TO WHERE YOU CALLED REMEMBER]]

During expansion of the template, special `%'-escapes(2) allow dynamic
insertion of content:
     %^{PROMPT}  prompt the user for a string and replace this sequence with it.
                 You may specify a default value and a completion table with
                 %^{prompt|default|completion2|completion3...}
                 The arrow keys access a prompt-specific history.
     %a          annotation, normally the link created with `org-store-link'
     %A          like `%a', but prompt for the description part
     %i          initial content, the region when remember is called with C-u.
                 The entire text will be indented like `%i' itself.
     %t          timestamp, date only
     %T          timestamp with date and time
     %u, %U      like the above, but inactive timestamps
     %^t         like `%t', but prompt for date.  Similarly `%^T', `%^u', `%^U'
                 You may define a prompt like `%^{Birthday}t'
     %n          user name (taken from `user-full-name')
     %c          Current kill ring head.
     %x          Content of the X clipboard.
     %^C         Interactive selection of which kill or clip to use.
     %^L         Like `%^C', but insert as link.
     %^g         prompt for tags, with completion on tags in target file.
     %k          title of currently clocked task
     %K          link to currently clocked task
     %^G         prompt for tags, with completion all tags in all agenda files.
     %^{PROP}p   Prompt the user for a value for property PROP
     %:keyword   specific information for certain link types, see below
     %[FILE]     insert the contents of the file given by FILE
     %(SEXP)     evaluate Elisp SEXP and replace with the result
     %!          immediately store note after completing the template
                 (skipping the `C-c C-c' that normally triggers storing)
     %&          jump to target location immediately after storing note

For specific link types, the following keywords will be defined(3):

     Link type          |  Available keywords
     -------------------+----------------------------------------------
     bbdb               |  %:name %:company
     bbdb               |  %::server %:port %:nick
     vm, wl, mh, rmail  |  %:type %:subject %:message-id
                        |  %:from %:fromname %:fromaddress
                        |  %:to   %:toname   %:toaddress
                        |  %:fromto (either "to NAME" or "from NAME")(4)
     gnus               |  %:group, for messages also all email fields
     w3, w3m            |  %:url
     info               |  %:file %:node
     calendar           |  %:date"

To place the cursor after template expansion use:

     %?          After completing the template, position cursor here.

If you change your mind about which template to use, call
`org-remember' in the remember buffer.  You may then select a new
template that will be filled with the previous context information.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If the file contains an entry with a `DATE_TREE' property, the
entire date tree will be build under that entry.

   (2) If you need one of these sequences literally, escape the `%'
with a backslash.

   (3) If you define your own link types (*note Adding hyperlink
types::), any property you store with `org-store-link-props' can be
accessed in remember templates in a similar way.

   (4) This will always be the other, not the user.  See the variable
`org-from-is-user-regexp'.


File: org,  Node: Storing notes,  Prev: Remember templates,  Up: Remember

9.1.3 Storing notes
-------------------

When you are finished preparing a note with Remember, you have to press
`C-c C-c' to file the note away.  If you have started the clock in the
Remember buffer, you will first be asked if you want to clock out
now(1).  If you answer `n', the clock will continue to run after the
note was filed away.

   The handler will then store the note in the file and under the
headline specified in the template, or it will use the default file and
headline.  The window configuration will be restored, sending you back
to the working context before the call to Remember.  To re-use the
location found during the last call to Remember, exit the Remember
buffer with `C-0 C-c C-c', i.e. specify a zero prefix argument to `C-c
C-c'.  Another special case is `C-2 C-c C-c' which files the note as a
child of the currently clocked item.

   If you want to store the note directly to a different place, use
`C-1 C-c C-c' instead to exit Remember(2).  The handler will then first
prompt for a target file--if you press <RET>, the value specified for
the template is used.  Then the command offers the headings tree of the
selected file, with the cursor position at the default headline (if you
specified one in the template).  You can either immediately press <RET>
to get the note placed there.  Or you can use the following keys to
find a different location:
     <TAB>         Cycle visibility.
     <down> / <up>   Next/previous visible headline.
     n / p        Next/previous visible headline.
     f / b        Next/previous headline same level.
     u            One level up.
   Pressing <RET> or <left> or <right> then leads to the following
result.

Cursor         Key         Note gets inserted
position                   
on headline    <RET>       as sublevel of the heading at cursor, first or
                           last
                           depending on `org-reverse-note-order'.
               <left>/<right>as same level, before/after current heading
buffer-start   <RET>       as level 2 heading at end of file or level 1
                           at beginning
                           depending on `org-reverse-note-order'.
not on         <RET>       at cursor position, level taken from context.
headline                   

   Before inserting the text into a tree, the function ensures that the
text has a headline, i.e. a first line that starts with a `*'.  If not,
a headline is constructed from the current date.  If you have indented
the text of the note below the headline, the indentation will be
adapted if inserting the note into the tree requires demotion from
level 1.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) To avoid this query, configure the variable
`org-remember-clock-out-on-exit'.

   (2) Configure the variable `org-remember-store-without-prompt' to
make this behavior the default.


File: org,  Node: Attachments,  Next: RSS Feeds,  Prev: Remember,  Up: Capture - Refile - Archive

9.2 Attachments
===============

It is often useful to associate reference material with an outline
node/task.  Small chunks of plain text can simply be stored in the
subtree of a project.  Hyperlinks (*note Hyperlinks::) can be used to
establish associations with files that live elsewhere on your computer
or in the cloud, like emails or source code files belonging to a
project.  Another method is attachments, which are files located in a
directory belonging to an outline node.  Org uses directories named by
the unique ID of each entry.  These directories are located in the
`data' directory which lives in the same directory where your Org file
lives(1).  If you initialize this directory with `git init', Org will
automatically commit changes when it sees them.  The attachment system
has been contributed to Org by John Wiegley.

   In cases where it seems better to do so, you can also attach a
directory of your choice to an entry.  You can also make children
inherit the attachment directory from a parent, so that an entire
subtree uses the same attached directory.

The following commands deal with attachments.

`C-c C-a'
     The dispatcher for commands related to the attachment system.
     After these keys, a list of commands is displayed and you need to
     press an additional key to select a command:

    `a'
          Select a file and move it into the task's attachment
          directory.  The file will be copied, moved, or linked,
          depending on `org-attach-method'.  Note that hard links are
          not supported on all systems.

    `c/m/l'
          Attach a file using the copy/move/link method.  Note that
          hard links are not supported on all systems.

    `n'
          Create a new attachment as an Emacs buffer.

    `z'
          Synchronize the current task with its attachment directory,
          in case you added attachments yourself.

    `o'
          Open current task's attachment.  If there are more than one,
          prompt for a file name first.  Opening will follow the rules
          set by `org-file-apps'.  For more details, see the
          information on following hyperlinks (*note Handling links::).

    `O'
          Also open the attachment, but force opening the file in Emacs.

    `f'
          Open the current task's attachment directory.

    `F'
          Also open the directory, but force using `dired' in Emacs.

    `d'
          Select and delete a single attachment.

    `D'
          Delete all of a task's attachments.  A safer way is to open
          the directory in `dired' and delete from there.

    `C-c C-a s'
          Set a specific directory as the entry's attachment directory.
          This works by putting the directory path into the
          `ATTACH_DIR' property.

    `C-c C-a i'
          Set the `ATTACH_DIR_INHERIT' property, so that children will
          use the same directory for attachments as the parent does.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If you move entries or Org files from one directory to another,
you may want to configure `org-attach-directory' to contain an absolute
path.


File: org,  Node: RSS Feeds,  Next: Protocols,  Prev: Attachments,  Up: Capture - Refile - Archive

9.3 RSS feeds
=============

Org has the capability to add and change entries based on information
found in RSS feeds.  You could use this to make a task out of each new
podcast in a podcast feed.  Or you could use a phone-based
note-creating service on the web to import tasks into Org.  To access
feeds, you need to configure the variable `org-feed-alist'.  The
docstring of this variable has detailed information.  Here is just an
example:

     (setq org-feed-alist
           '(("ReQall" "http://www.reqall.com/user/feeds/rss/a1b2c3....."
              "~/org/feeds.org" "ReQall Entries")
   will configure that new items from the feed provided by `reqall.com'
will result in new entries in the file `~/org/feeds.org' under the
heading `ReQall Entries', whenever the following command is used:

`C-c C-x g'
     Collect items from the feeds configured in `org-feed-alist' and
     act upon them.  

`C-c C-x G'
     Prompt for a feed name and go to the inbox configured for this
     feed.

   Under the same headline, Org will create a drawer `FEEDSTATUS' in
which it will store information about the status of items in the feed,
to avoid adding the same item several times.  You should add
`FEEDSTATUS' to the list of drawers in that file:

     #+DRAWERS: LOGBOOK PROPERTIES FEEDSTATUS

   For more information, see `org-feed.el' and the docstring of
`org-feed-alist'.

9.4 Protocols for external access
=================================

You can set up Org for handling protocol calls from outside
applications that are passed to Emacs through the `emacsserver'.  For
example, you can configure bookmarks in your web browser to send a link
to the current page to Org and create a note from it using Remember
(*note Remember::).  Or you could create a bookmark that will tell
Emacs to open the local source file of a remote website you are looking
at with the browser.  See
`http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.php' for detailed
documentation and setup instructions.


File: org,  Node: Refiling notes,  Next: Archiving,  Prev: Protocols,  Up: Capture - Refile - Archive

9.5 Refiling notes
==================

When reviewing the captured data, you may want to refile some of the
entries into a different list, for example into a project.  Cutting,
finding the right location, and then pasting the note is cumbersome.
To simplify this process, you can use the following special command:

`C-c C-w'
     Refile the entry or region at point.  This command offers possible
     locations for refiling the entry and lets you select one with
     completion.  The item (or all items in the region) is filed below
     the target heading as a subitem.  Depending on
     `org-reverse-note-order', it will be either the first or last
     subitem.
     By default, all level 1 headlines in the current buffer are
     considered to be targets, but you can have more complex
     definitions across a number of files.  See the variable
     `org-refile-targets' for details.  If you would like to select a
     location via a file-path-like completion along the outline path,
     see the variables `org-refile-use-outline-path' and
     `org-outline-path-complete-in-steps'.  If you would like to be
     able to create new nodes as new parents for refiling on the fly,
     check the variable `org-refile-allow-creating-parent-nodes'.  

`C-u C-c C-w'
     Use the refile interface to jump to a heading.  

`C-u C-u C-c C-w'
     Jump to the location where `org-refile' last moved a tree to.

`C-2 C-c C-w'
     Refile as the child of the item currently being clocked.

9.6 Archiving
=============

When a project represented by a (sub)tree is finished, you may want to
move the tree out of the way and to stop it from contributing to the
agenda.  Archiving is important to keep your working files compact and
global searches like the construction of agenda views fast.

`C-c C-x C-a'
     Archive the current entry using the command specified in the
     variable `org-archive-default-command'.

* Menu:

* Moving subtrees::             Moving a tree to an archive file
* Internal archiving::          Switch off a tree but keep i in the file


File: org,  Node: Moving subtrees,  Next: Internal archiving,  Prev: Archiving,  Up: Archiving

9.6.1 Moving a tree to the archive file
---------------------------------------

The most common archiving action is to move a project tree to another
file, the archive file.

`C-c C-x C-s or short  C-c $'
     Archive the subtree starting at the cursor position to the location
     given by `org-archive-location'.  

`C-u C-c C-x C-s'
     Check if any direct children of the current headline could be
     moved to the archive.  To do this, each subtree is checked for
     open TODO entries.  If none are found, the command offers to move
     it to the archive location.  If the cursor is _not_ on a headline
     when this command is invoked, the level 1 trees will be checked.

   The default archive location is a file in the same directory as the
current file, with the name derived by appending `_archive' to the
current file name.  For information and examples on how to change this,
see the documentation string of the variable `org-archive-location'.
There is also an in-buffer option for setting this variable, for
example(1):

     #+ARCHIVE: %s_done::

If you would like to have a special ARCHIVE location for a single entry
or a (sub)tree, give the entry an `:ARCHIVE:' property with the
location as the value (*note Properties and Columns::).

   When a subtree is moved, it receives a number of special properties
that record context information like the file from where the entry
came, its outline path the archiving time etc.  Configure the variable
`org-archive-save-context-info' to adjust the amount of information
added.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) For backward compatibility, the following also works: If there
are several such lines in a file, each specifies the archive location
for the text below it.  The first such line also applies to any text
before its definition.  However, using this method is _strongly_
deprecated as it is incompatible with the outline structure of the
document.  The correct method for setting multiple archive locations in
a buffer is using properties.


File: org,  Node: Internal archiving,  Prev: Moving subtrees,  Up: Archiving

9.6.2 Internal archiving
------------------------

If you want to just switch off (for agenda views) certain subtrees
without moving them to a different file, you can use the `ARCHIVE tag'.

   A headline that is marked with the ARCHIVE tag (*note Tags::) stays
at its location in the outline tree, but behaves in the following way:
   - It does not open when you attempt to do so with a visibility
     cycling command (*note Visibility cycling::).  You can force
     cycling archived subtrees with `C-<TAB>', or by setting the option
     `org-cycle-open-archived-trees'.  Also normal outline commands like
     `show-all' will open archived subtrees.

   - During sparse tree construction (*note Sparse trees::), matches in
     archived subtrees are not exposed, unless you configure the option
     `org-sparse-tree-open-archived-trees'.

   - During agenda view construction (*note Agenda Views::), the
     content of archived trees is ignored unless you configure the
     option `org-agenda-skip-archived-trees', in which case these trees
     will always be included.  In the agenda you can press `v a' to get
     archives temporarily included.

   - Archived trees are not exported (*note Exporting::), only the
     headline is.  Configure the details using the variable
     `org-export-with-archived-trees'.

   - Archived trees are excluded from column view unless the variable
     `org-columns-skip-arrchived-trees' is configured to `nil'.

   The following commands help managing the ARCHIVE tag:

`C-c C-x a'
     Toggle the ARCHIVE tag for the current headline.  When the tag is
     set, the headline changes to a shadowed face, and the subtree
     below it is hidden.  

`C-u C-c C-x a'
     Check if any direct children of the current headline should be
     archived.  To do this, each subtree is checked for open TODO
     entries.  If none are found, the command offers to set the ARCHIVE
     tag for the child.  If the cursor is _not_ on a headline when this
     command is invoked, the level 1 trees will be checked.  

`C-TAB'
     Cycle a tree even if it is tagged with ARCHIVE.  

`C-c C-x A'
     Move the current entry to the _Archive Sibling_.  This is a
     sibling of the entry with the heading `Archive' and the tag
     `ARCHIVE'.  The entry becomes a child of that sibling and in this
     way retains a lot of its original context, including inherited
     tags and approximate position in the outline.

10 Agenda Views
***************

Due to the way Org works, TODO items, time-stamped items, and tagged
headlines can be scattered throughout a file or even a number of files.
To get an overview of open action items, or of events that are
important for a particular date, this information must be collected,
sorted and displayed in an organized way.

   Org can select items based on various criteria and display them in a
separate buffer.  Seven different view types are provided:

   * an _agenda_ that is like a calendar and shows information for
     specific dates,

   * a _TODO list_ that covers all unfinished action items,

   * a _match view_, showings headlines based on the tags, properties,
     and TODO state associated with them,

   * a _timeline view_ that shows all events in a single Org file, in
     time-sorted view,

   * a _text search view_ that shows all entries from multiple files
     that contain specified keywords,

   * a _stuck projects view_ showing projects that currently don't move
     along, and

   * _custom views_ that are special searches and combinations of
     different views.

The extracted information is displayed in a special _agenda buffer_.
This buffer is read-only, but provides commands to visit the
corresponding locations in the original Org files, and even to edit
these files remotely.

   Two variables control how the agenda buffer is displayed and whether
the window configuration is restored when the agenda exits:
`org-agenda-window-setup' and `org-agenda-restore-windows-after-quit'.

* Menu:

* Agenda files::                Files being searched for agenda information
* Agenda dispatcher::           Keyboard access to agenda views
* Built-in agenda views::       What is available out of the box?
* Presentation and sorting::    How agenda items are prepared for display
* Agenda commands::             Remote editing of Org trees
* Custom agenda views::         Defining special searches and views
* Exporting Agenda Views::      Writing a view to a file
* Agenda column view::          Using column view for collected entries


File: org,  Node: Agenda files,  Next: Agenda dispatcher,  Prev: Agenda Views,  Up: Agenda Views

10.1 Agenda files
=================

The information to be shown is normally collected from all _agenda
files_, the files listed in the variable `org-agenda-files'(1). If a
directory is part of this list, all files with the extension `.org' in
this directory will be part of the list.

   Thus, even if you only work with a single Org file, that file should
be put into the list(2).  You can customize `org-agenda-files', but the
easiest way to maintain it is through the following commands

`C-c ['
     Add current file to the list of agenda files.  The file is added to
     the front of the list.  If it was already in the list, it is moved
     to the front.  With a prefix argument, file is added/moved to the
     end.  

`C-c ]'
     Remove current file from the list of agenda files.  

`C-,'
`C-''
     Cycle through agenda file list, visiting one file after the other.  

`M-x org-iswitchb'
     Command to use an `iswitchb'-like interface to switch to and
     between Org buffers.

The Org menu contains the current list of files and can be used to
visit any of them.

   If you would like to focus the agenda temporarily on a file not in
this list, or on just one file in the list, or even on only a subtree
in a file, then this can be done in different ways.  For a single
agenda command, you may press `<' once or several times in the
dispatcher (*note Agenda dispatcher::).  To restrict the agenda scope
for an extended period, use the following commands:

`C-c C-x <'
     Permanently restrict the agenda to the current subtree.  When with
     a prefix argument, or with the cursor before the first headline in
     a file, the agenda scope is set to the entire file.  This
     restriction remains in effect until removed with `C-c C-x >', or
     by typing either `<' or `>' in the agenda dispatcher.  If there is
     a window displaying an agenda view, the new restriction takes
     effect immediately.  

`C-c C-x >'
     Remove the permanent restriction created by `C-c C-x <'.

When working with `speedbar.el', you can use the following commands in
the Speedbar frame:
`< in the speedbar frame'
     Permanently restrict the agenda to the item--either an Org file or
     a subtree in such a file--at the cursor in the Speedbar frame.  If
     there is a window displaying an agenda view, the new restriction
     takes effect immediately.  

`> in the speedbar frame'
     Lift the restriction.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If the value of that variable is not a list, but a single file
name, then the list of agenda files will be maintained in that external
file.

   (2) When using the dispatcher, pressing `<' before selecting a
command will actually limit the command to the current file, and ignore
`org-agenda-files' until the next dispatcher command.

10.2 The agenda dispatcher
==========================

The views are created through a dispatcher, which should be bound to a
global key--for example `C-c a' (*note Installation::).  In the
following we will assume that `C-c a' is indeed how the dispatcher is
accessed and list keyboard access to commands accordingly.  After
pressing `C-c a', an additional letter is required to execute a
command.  The dispatcher offers the following default commands:
`a'
     Create the calendar-like agenda (*note Weekly/daily agenda::).

`t / T'
     Create a list of all TODO items (*note Global TODO list::).

`m / M'
     Create a list of headlines matching a TAGS expression (*note
     Matching tags and properties::).

`L'
     Create the timeline view for the current buffer (*note Timeline::).

`s'
     Create a list of entries selected by a boolean expression of
     keywords and/or regular expressions that must or must not occur in
     the entry.

`/'
     Search for a regular expression in all agenda files and
     additionally in the files listed in
     `org-agenda-text-search-extra-files'.  This uses the Emacs command
     `multi-occur'.  A prefix argument can be used to specify the
     number of context lines for each match, default is 1.

`# / !'
     Create a list of stuck projects (*note Stuck projects::).

`<'
     Restrict an agenda command to the current buffer(1).  After
     pressing `<', you still need to press the character selecting the
     command.

`< <'
     If there is an active region, restrict the following agenda
     command to the region.  Otherwise, restrict it to the current
     subtree(2).  After pressing `< <', you still need to press the
     character selecting the command.

   You can also define custom commands that will be accessible through
the dispatcher, just like the default commands.  This includes the
possibility to create extended agenda buffers that contain several
blocks together, for example the weekly agenda, the global TODO list and
a number of special tags matches.  *Note Custom agenda views::.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) For backward compatibility, you can also press `1' to restrict
to the current buffer.

   (2) For backward compatibility, you can also press `0' to restrict
to the current region/subtree.

File: org,  Node: Weekly/daily agenda,  Next: Global TODO list,  Prev: Built-in agenda views,  Up: Built-in agenda views

10.3.1 The weekly/daily agenda
------------------------------

The purpose of the weekly/daily _agenda_ is to act like a page of a
paper agenda, showing all the tasks for the current week or day.

`C-c a a'
     Compile an agenda for the current week from a list of Org files.
     The agenda shows the entries for each day.  With a numeric
     prefix(1)  (like `C-u 2 1 C-c a a') you may set the number of days
     to be displayed (see also the variable `org-agenda-ndays')

   Remote editing from the agenda buffer means, for example, that you
can change the dates of deadlines and appointments from the agenda
buffer.  The commands available in the Agenda buffer are listed in
*note Agenda commands::.

Calendar/Diary integration
..........................

Emacs contains the calendar and diary by Edward M. Reingold.  The
calendar displays a three-month calendar with holidays from different
countries and cultures.  The diary allows you to keep track of
anniversaries, lunar phases, sunrise/set, recurrent appointments
(weekly, monthly) and more.  In this way, it is quite complementary to
Org.  It can be very useful to combine output from Org with the diary.

   In order to include entries from the Emacs diary into Org mode's
agenda, you only need to customize the variable

     (setq org-agenda-include-diary t)

After that, everything will happen automatically.  All diary entries
including holidays, anniversaries, etc., will be included in the agenda
buffer created by Org mode.  <SPC>, <TAB>, and <RET> can be used from
the agenda buffer to jump to the diary file in order to edit existing
diary entries.  The `i' command to insert new entries for the current
date works in the agenda buffer, as well as the commands `S', `M', and
`C' to display Sunrise/Sunset times, show lunar phases and to convert
to other calendars, respectively.  `c' can be used to switch back and
forth between calendar and agenda.

   If you are using the diary only for sexp entries and holidays, it is
faster to not use the above setting, but instead to copy or even move
the entries into an Org file. Org mode evaluates diary-style sexp
entries, and does it faster because there is no overhead for first
creating the diary display.  Note that the sexp entries must start at
the left margin, no whitespace is allowed before them.  For example,
the following segment of an Org file will be processed and entries will
be made in the agenda:

     * Birthdays and similar stuff
     #+CATEGORY: Holiday
     %%(org-calendar-holiday)   ; special function for holiday names
     #+CATEGORY: Ann
     %%(diary-anniversary 14  5 1956) Arthur Dent is %d years old
     %%(diary-anniversary  2 10 1869) Mahatma Gandhi would be %d years old

Anniversaries from BBDB
.......................

If you are using the Big Brothers Database to store your contacts, you
will very likely prefer to store anniversaries in BBDB rather than in a
separate Org or diary file.  Org supports this and will show BBDB
anniversaries as part of the agenda.  All you need to do is to add the
following to one your your agenda files:

     * Anniversaries
       :PROPERTIES:
       :CATEGORY: Anniv
       :END
     %%(org-bbdb-anniversaries)

   You can then go ahead and define anniversaries for a BBDB record.
Basically, you need to press `C-o anniversary <RET>' with the cursor in
a BBDB record and then add the date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD',
followed by a space and the class of the anniversary (`birthday' or
`wedding', or a format string).  If you omit the class, it will default
to `birthday'.  Here are a few examples, the header for the file
`org-bbdb.el' contains more detailed information.

     1973-06-22
     1955-08-02 wedding
     2008-04-14 %s released version 6.01 of org-mode, %d years ago

   After a change to BBDB, or for the first agenda display during an
Emacs session, the agenda display will suffer a short delay as Org
updates its hash with anniversaries.  However, from then on things will
be very fast--much faster in fact than a long list of
`%%(diary-anniversary)' entries in an Org or Diary file.

Appointment reminders
.....................

Org can interact with Emacs appointments notification facility.  To add
all the appointments of your agenda files, use the command
`org-agenda-to-appt'.  This command also lets you filter through the
list of your appointments and add only those belonging to a specific
category or matching a regular expression. See the docstring for
details.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) For backward compatibility, the universal prefix `C-u' causes
all TODO entries to be listed before the agenda.  This feature is
deprecated, use the dedicated TODO list, or a block agenda instead
(*note Block agenda::).


File: org,  Node: Global TODO list,  Next: Matching tags and properties,  Prev: Weekly/daily agenda,  Up: Built-in agenda views

10.3.2 The global TODO list
---------------------------

The global TODO list contains all unfinished TODO items formatted and
collected into a single place.

`C-c a t'
     Show the global TODO list.  This collects the TODO items from all
     agenda files (*note Agenda Views::) into a single buffer.  The
     buffer is in `agenda-mode', so there are commands to examine and
     manipulate the TODO entries directly from that buffer (*note
     Agenda commands::).  

`C-c a T'
     Like the above, but allows selection of a specific TODO keyword.
     You can also do this by specifying a prefix argument to `C-c a t'.
     With a `C-u' prefix you are prompted for a keyword, and you may
     also specify several keywords by separating them with `|' as the
     boolean OR operator.  With a numeric prefix, the nth keyword in
     `org-todo-keywords' is selected.  The `r' key in the agenda buffer
     regenerates it, and you can give a prefix argument to this command
     to change the selected TODO keyword, for example `3 r'.  If you
     often need a search for a specific keyword, define a custom
     command for it (*note Agenda dispatcher::).
     Matching specific TODO keywords can also be done as part of a tags
     search (*note Tag searches::).

   Remote editing of TODO items means that you can change the state of a
TODO entry with a single key press.  The commands available in the TODO
list are described in *note Agenda commands::.

   Normally the global TODO list simply shows all headlines with TODO
keywords.  This list can become very long.  There are two ways to keep
it more compact:
   - Some people view a TODO item that has been _scheduled_ for
     execution or have a _deadline_ (*note Timestamps::) as no longer
     _open_.  Configure the variables
     `org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled',
     `org-agenda-todo-ignore-deadlines', and/or
     `org-agenda-todo-ignore-with-date' to exclude such items from the
     global TODO list.

   - TODO items may have sublevels to break up the task into subtasks.
     In such cases it may be enough to list only the highest level TODO
     headline and omit the sublevels from the global list.  Configure
     the variable `org-agenda-todo-list-sublevels' to get this behavior.


File: org,  Node: Matching tags and properties,  Next: Timeline,  Prev: Global TODO list,  Up: Built-in agenda views

10.3.3 Matching tags and properties
-----------------------------------

If headlines in the agenda files are marked with _tags_ (*note Tags::),
or have properties (*note Properties and Columns::), you can select
headlines based on this metadata and collect them into an agenda
buffer.  The match syntax described here also applies when creating
sparse trees with `C-c / m'.

`C-c a m'
     Produce a list of all headlines that match a given set of tags.
     The command prompts for a selection criterion, which is a boolean
     logic expression with tags, like `+work+urgent-withboss' or
     `work|home' (*note Tags::).  If you often need a specific search,
     define a custom command for it (*note Agenda dispatcher::).  

`C-c a M'
     Like `C-c a m', but only select headlines that are also TODO items
     and force checking subitems (see variable
     `org-tags-match-list-sublevels').  To exclude scheduled/deadline
     items, see the variable
     `org-agenda-tags-todo-honor-ignore-options'.  Matching specific
     TODO keywords together with a tags match is also possible, see
     *note Tag searches::.

   The commands available in the tags list are described in *note
Agenda commands::.

Match syntax
............

A search string can use Boolean operators `&' for AND and `|' for OR.
`&' binds more strongly than `|'.  Parentheses are currently not
implemented.  Each element in the search is either a tag, a regular
expression matching tags, or an expression like `PROPERTY OPERATOR
VALUE' with a comparison operator, accessing a property value.  Each
element may be preceded by `-', to select against it, and `+' is
syntactic sugar for positive selection.  The AND operator `&' is
optional when `+' or `-' is present.  Here are some examples, using
only tags.

`+work-boss'
     Select headlines tagged `:work:', but discard those also tagged
     `:boss:'.

`work|laptop'
     Selects lines tagged `:work:' or `:laptop:'.

`work|laptop+night'
     Like before, but require the `:laptop:' lines to be tagged also
     `:night:'.

   Instead of a tag, you may also specify a regular expression enclosed
in curly braces.  For example, `work+{^boss.*}' matches headlines that
contain the tag `:work:' and any tag starting with `boss'.

   You may also test for properties (*note Properties and Columns::) at
the same time as matching tags.  The properties may be real properties,
or special properties that represent other metadata (*note Special
properties::).  For example, the "property" `TODO' represents the TODO
keyword of the entry.  Or, the "property" `LEVEL' represents the level
of an entry.  So a search `+LEVEL=3+boss-TODO="DONE"' lists all level
three headlines that have the tag `boss' and are _not_ marked with the
TODO keyword DONE.  In buffers with `org-odd-levels-only' set, `LEVEL'
does not count the number of stars, but `LEVEL=2' will correspond to 3
stars etc.

   Here are more examples:
`work+TODO="WAITING"'
     Select `:work:'-tagged TODO lines with the specific TODO keyword
     `WAITING'.

`work+TODO="WAITING"|home+TODO="WAITING"'
     Waiting tasks both at work and at home.

   When matching properties, a number of different operators can be
used to test the value of a property.  Here is a complex example:

     +work-boss+PRIORITY="A"+Coffee="unlimited"+Effort<2         \
              +With={Sarah\|Denny}+SCHEDULED>="<2008-10-11>"

The type of comparison will depend on how the comparison value is
written:
   - If the comparison value is a plain number, a numerical comparison
     is done, and the allowed operators are `<', `=', `>', `<=', `>=',
     and `<>'.

   - If the comparison value is enclosed in double-quotes, a string
     comparison is done, and the same operators are allowed.

   - If the comparison value is enclosed in double-quotes _and_ angular
     brackets (like `DEADLINE<="<2008-12-24 18:30>"'), both values are
     assumed to be date/time specifications in the standard Org way,
     and the comparison will be done accordingly.  Special values that
     will be recognized are `"<now>"' for now (including time), and
     `"<today>"', and `"<tomorrow>"' for these days at 0:00 hours, i.e.
     without a time specification.  Also strings like `"<+5d>"' or
     `"<-2m>"' with units `d', `w', `m', and `y' for day, week, month,
     and year, respectively, can be used.

   - If the comparison value is enclosed in curly braces, a regexp
     match is performed, with `=' meaning that the regexp matches the
     property value, and `<>' meaning that it does not match.

   So the search string in the example finds entries tagged `:work:' but
not `:boss:', which also have a priority value `A', a `:Coffee:'
property with the value `unlimited', an `Effort' property that is
numerically smaller than 2, a `:With:' property that is matched by the
regular expression `Sarah\|Denny', and that are scheduled on or after
October 11, 2008.

   Accessing TODO, LEVEL, and CATEGORY during a search is fast.
Accessing any other properties will slow down the search.  However,
once you have paid the price by accessing one property, testing
additional properties is cheap again.

   You can configure Org mode to use property inheritance during a
search, but beware that this can slow down searches considerably.  See
*note Property inheritance::, for details.

   For backward compatibility, and also for typing speed, there is also
a different way to test TODO states in a search.  For this, terminate
the tags/property part of the search string (which may include several
terms connected with `|') with a `/' and then specify a Boolean
expression just for TODO keywords.  The syntax is then similar to that
for tags, but should be applied with care: for example, a positive
selection on several TODO keywords cannot meaningfully be combined with
boolean AND.  However, _negative selection_ combined with AND can be
meaningful.  To make sure that only lines are checked that actually
have any TODO keyword (resulting in a speed-up), use `C-c a M', or
equivalently start the TODO part after the slash with `!'.  Examples:

`work/WAITING'
     Same as `work+TODO="WAITING"'

`work/!-WAITING-NEXT'
     Select `:work:'-tagged TODO lines that are neither `WAITING' nor
     `NEXT'

`work/!+WAITING|+NEXT'
     Select `:work:'-tagged TODO lines that are either `WAITING' or
     `NEXT'.

10.3.4 Timeline for a single file
---------------------------------

The timeline summarizes all time-stamped items from a single Org mode
file in a _time-sorted view_.  The main purpose of this command is to
give an overview over events in a project.

`C-c a L'
     Show a time-sorted view of the Org file, with all time-stamped
     items.  When called with a `C-u' prefix, all unfinished TODO
     entries (scheduled or not) are also listed under the current date.

The commands available in the timeline buffer are listed in *note
Agenda commands::.


File: org,  Node: Search view,  Next: Stuck projects,  Prev: Timeline,  Up: Built-in agenda views

10.3.5 Search view
------------------

This agenda view is a general text search facility for Org mode entries.
It is particularly useful to find notes.

`C-c a s'
     This is a special search that lets you select entries by matching
     a substring or specific words using a boolean logic.
   For example, the search string `computer equipment' will find entries
that contain `computer equipment' as a substring.  If the two words are
separated by more space or a line break, the search will still match.
Search view can also search for specific keywords in the entry, using
Boolean logic.  The search string `+computer +wifi -ethernet
-{8\.11[bg]}' will search for note entries that contain the keywords
`computer' and `wifi', but not the keyword `ethernet', and which are
also not matched by the regular expression `8\.11[bg]', meaning to
exclude both 8.11b and 8.11g.

   Note that in addition to the agenda files, this command will also
search the files listed in `org-agenda-text-search-extra-files'.


File: org,  Node: Stuck projects,  Prev: Search view,  Up: Built-in agenda views

10.3.6 Stuck projects
---------------------

If you are following a system like David Allen's GTD to organize your
work, one of the "duties" you have is a regular review to make sure
that all projects move along.  A _stuck_ project is a project that has
no defined next actions, so it will never show up in the TODO lists Org
mode produces.  During the review, you need to identify such projects
and define next actions for them.

`C-c a #'
     List projects that are stuck.  

`C-c a !'
     Customize the variable `org-stuck-projects' to define what a stuck
     project is and how to find it.

   You almost certainly will have to configure this view before it will
work for you.  The built-in default assumes that all your projects are
level-2 headlines, and that a project is not stuck if it has at least
one entry marked with a TODO keyword TODO or NEXT or NEXTACTION.

   Let's assume that you, in your own way of using Org mode, identify
projects with a tag PROJECT, and that you use a TODO keyword MAYBE to
indicate a project that should not be considered yet.  Let's further
assume that the TODO keyword DONE marks finished projects, and that NEXT
and TODO indicate next actions.  The tag @SHOP indicates shopping and
is a next action even without the NEXT tag.  Finally, if the project
contains the special word IGNORE anywhere, it should not be listed
either.  In this case you would start by identifying eligible projects
with a tags/todo match(1) `+PROJECT/-MAYBE-DONE', and then check for
TODO, NEXT, @SHOP, and IGNORE in the subtree to identify projects that
are not stuck.  The correct customization for this is

     (setq org-stuck-projects
           '("+PROJECT/-MAYBE-DONE" ("NEXT" "TODO") ("@SHOP")
                                    "\\<IGNORE\\>"))

   Note that if a project is identified as non-stuck, the subtree of
this entry will still be searched for stuck projects.

10.4 Presentation and sorting
=============================

Before displaying items in an agenda view, Org mode visually prepares
the items and sorts them.  Each item occupies a single line.  The line
starts with a _prefix_ that contains the _category_ (*note
Categories::) of the item and other important information.  You can
customize the prefix using the option `org-agenda-prefix-format'.  The
prefix is followed by a cleaned-up version of the outline headline
associated with the item.

* Menu:

* Categories::                  Not all tasks are equal
* Time-of-day specifications::  How the agenda knows the time
* Sorting of agenda items::     The order of things


File: org,  Node: Categories,  Next: Time-of-day specifications,  Prev: Presentation and sorting,  Up: Presentation and sorting

10.4.1 Categories
-----------------

The category is a broad label assigned to each agenda item.  By default,
the category is simply derived from the file name, but you can also
specify it with a special line in the buffer, like this(1):

     #+CATEGORY: Thesis

If you would like to have a special CATEGORY for a single entry or a
(sub)tree, give the entry a `:CATEGORY:' property with the special
category you want to apply as the value.

The display in the agenda buffer looks best if the category is not
longer than 10 characters.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) For backward compatibility, the following also works: if there
are several such lines in a file, each specifies the category for the
text below it.  The first category also applies to any text before the
first CATEGORY line.  However, using this method is _strongly_
deprecated as it is incompatible with the outline structure of the
document.  The correct method for setting multiple categories in a
buffer is using a property.


File: org,  Node: Time-of-day specifications,  Next: Sorting of agenda items,  Prev: Categories,  Up: Presentation and sorting

10.4.2 Time-of-day specifications
---------------------------------

Org mode checks each agenda item for a time-of-day specification.  The
time can be part of the timestamp that triggered inclusion into the
agenda, for example as in `<2005-05-10 Tue 19:00>'.  Time ranges can be
specified with two timestamps, like
`<2005-05-10 Tue 20:30>--<2005-05-10 Tue 22:15>'.

   In the headline of the entry itself, a time(range) may also appear as
plain text (like `12:45' or a `8:30-1pm').  If the agenda integrates
the Emacs diary (*note Weekly/daily agenda::), time specifications in
diary entries are recognized as well.

   For agenda display, Org mode extracts the time and displays it in a
standard 24 hour format as part of the prefix.  The example times in
the previous paragraphs would end up in the agenda like this:

         8:30-13:00 Arthur Dent lies in front of the bulldozer
        12:45...... Ford Prefect arrives and takes Arthur to the pub
        19:00...... The Vogon reads his poem
        20:30-22:15 Marvin escorts the Hitchhikers to the bridge

   If the agenda is in single-day mode, or for the display of today, the
timed entries are embedded in a time grid, like

         8:00...... ------------------
         8:30-13:00 Arthur Dent lies in front of the bulldozer
        10:00...... ------------------
        12:00...... ------------------
        12:45...... Ford Prefect arrives and takes Arthur to the pub
        14:00...... ------------------
        16:00...... ------------------
        18:00...... ------------------
        19:00...... The Vogon reads his poem
        20:00...... ------------------
        20:30-22:15 Marvin escorts the Hitchhikers to the bridge

   The time grid can be turned on and off with the variable
`org-agenda-use-time-grid', and can be configured with
`org-agenda-time-grid'.

Before being inserted into a view, the items are sorted.  How this is
done depends on the type of view.
   * For the daily/weekly agenda, the items for each day are sorted.
     The default order is to first collect all items containing an
     explicit time-of-day specification.  These entries will be shown
     at the beginning of the list, as a _schedule_ for the day.  After
     that, items remain grouped in categories, in the sequence given by
     `org-agenda-files'.  Within each category, items are sorted by
     priority (*note Priorities::), which is composed of the base
     priority (2000 for priority `A', 1000 for `B', and 0 for `C'),
     plus additional increments for overdue scheduled or deadline items.

   * For the TODO list, items remain in the order of categories, but
     within each category, sorting takes place according to priority
     (*note Priorities::).  The priority used for sorting derives from
     the priority cookie, with additions depending on how close an item
     is to its due or scheduled date.

   * For tags matches, items are not sorted at all, but just appear in
     the sequence in which they are found in the agenda files.

   Sorting can be customized using the variable
`org-agenda-sorting-strategy', and may also include criteria based on
the estimated effort of an entry (*note Effort estimates::).

10.5 Commands in the agenda buffer
==================================

Entries in the agenda buffer are linked back to the Org file or diary
file where they originate.  You are not allowed to edit the agenda
buffer itself, but commands are provided to show and jump to the
original entry location, and to edit the Org files "remotely" from the
agenda buffer.  In this way, all information is stored only once,
removing the risk that your agenda and note files may diverge.

   Some commands can be executed with mouse clicks on agenda lines.  For
the other commands, the cursor needs to be in the desired line.

Motion
......

`n'
     Next line (same as <up> and `C-p').  

`p'
     Previous line (same as <down> and `C-n').

View/Go to Org file
...................

`mouse-3'
`<SPC>'
     Display the original location of the item in another window.  With
     prefix arg, make sure that the entire entry is made visible in the
     outline, not only the heading.  

`L'
     Display original location and recenter that window.  

`mouse-2'
`mouse-1'
`<TAB>'
     Go to the original location of the item in another window.  Under
     Emacs 22, `mouse-1' will also works for this.  

`<RET>'
     Go to the original location of the item and delete other windows.  

`F'
     Toggle Follow mode.  In Follow mode, as you move the cursor through
     the agenda buffer, the other window always shows the corresponding
     location in the Org file.  The initial setting for this mode in new
     agenda buffers can be set with the variable
     `org-agenda-start-with-follow-mode'.  

`C-c C-x b'
     Display the entire subtree of the current item in an indirect
     buffer.  With a numeric prefix argument N, go up to level N and
     then take that tree.  If N is negative, go up that many levels.
     With a `C-u' prefix, do not remove the previously used indirect
     buffer.

`C-c C-o'
     Follow a link in the entry.  This will offer a selection of any
     links in the text belonging to the referenced Org node.  If there
     is only one link, it will be followed without a selection prompt.

Change display
..............

`o'
     Delete other windows.  

`v d  or short  d'
`v w  or short  w'
`v m'
`v y'
     Switch to day/week/month/year view.  When switching to day or week
     view, this setting becomes the default for subsequent agenda
     commands.  Since month and year views are slow to create, they do
     not become the default.  A numeric prefix argument may be used to
     jump directly to a specific day of the year, ISO week, month, or
     year, respectively.  For example, `32 d' jumps to February 1st, `9
     w' to ISO week number 9.  When setting day, week, or month view, a
     year may be encoded in the prefix argument as well.  For example,
     `200712 w' will jump to week 12 in 2007.  If such a year
     specification has only one or two digits, it will be mapped to the
     interval 1938-2037.  

`f'
     Go forward in time to display the following `org-agenda-ndays'
     days.  For example, if the display covers a week, switch to the
     following week.  With prefix arg, go forward that many times
     `org-agenda-ndays' days.  

`b'
     Go backward in time to display earlier dates.  

`.'
     Go to today.  

`j'
     Prompt for a date and go there.  

`D'
     Toggle the inclusion of diary entries.  See *note Weekly/daily
     agenda::.  

`v l  or short  l'
     Toggle Logbook mode.  In Logbook mode, entries that were marked
     DONE while logging was on (variable `org-log-done') are shown in
     the agenda, as are entries that have been clocked on that day.
     You can configure the entry types that should be included in log
     mode using the variable `org-agenda-log-mode-items'.  When called
     with a `C-u' prefix, show all possible logbook entries, including
     state changes.  When called with two prefix args `C-u C-u', show
     only logging information, nothing else.  

`v [  or short  ['
     Include inactive timestamps into the current view.  Only for
     weekly/daily agenda and timeline views.  

`v a'
`v A'
     Toggle Archives mode.  In Archives mode, trees that are marked
     `ARCHIVED' are also scanned when producing the agenda.  When you
     use the capital `A', even all archive files are included.  To exit
     archives mode, press `v a' again.  

`v R  or short  R'
     Toggle Clockreport mode.  In Clockreport mode, the daily/weekly
     agenda will always show a table with the clocked times for the
     timespan and file scope covered by the current agenda view.  The
     initial setting for this mode in new agenda buffers can be set
     with the variable `org-agenda-start-with-clockreport-mode'.  

`v E  or short  E'
     Toggle entry text mode.  In entry text mode, a number of lines
     from the Org outline node referenced by an agenda line will be
     displayed below the line.  The maximum number of lines is given by
     the variable `org-agenda-entry-text-maxlines'.  Calling this
     command with a numeric prefix argument will temporarily modify
     that number to the prefix value.  

`G'
     Toggle the time grid on and off.  See also the variables
     `org-agenda-use-time-grid' and `org-agenda-time-grid'.  

`r'
     Recreate the agenda buffer, for example to reflect the changes
     after modification of the timestamps of items with `S-<left>' and
     `S-<right>'.  When the buffer is the global TODO list, a prefix
     argument is interpreted to create a selective list for a specific
     TODO keyword.  

`g'
     Same as `r'.  

`s'
`C-x C-s'
     Save all Org buffers in the current Emacs session, and also the
     locations of IDs.  

`C-c C-x C-c'
     Invoke column view (*note Column view::) in the agenda buffer.
     The column view format is taken from the entry at point, or (if
     there is no entry at point), from the first entry in the agenda
     view.  So whatever the format for that entry would be in the
     original buffer (taken from a property, from a `#+COLUMNS' line,
     or from the default variable `org-columns-default-format'), will
     be used in the agenda.

`C-c C-x >'
     Remove the restriction lock on the agenda, if it is currently
     restricted to a file or subtree (*note Agenda files::).

Secondary filtering and query editing
.....................................

`/'
     Filter the current agenda view with respect to a tag and/or effort
     estimates.  The difference between this and a custom agenda
     command is that filtering is very fast, so that you can switch
     quickly between different filters without having to recreate the
     agenda(1)

     You will be prompted for a tag selection letter, SPC will mean any
     tag at all.  Pressing <TAB> at that prompt will offer use
     completion to select a tag (including any tags that do not have a
     selection character).  The command then hides all entries that do
     not contain or inherit this tag.  When called with prefix arg,
     remove the entries that _do_ have the tag.  A second `/' at the
     prompt will turn off the filter and unhide any hidden entries.  If
     the first key you press is either `+' or `-', the previous filter
     will be narrowed by requiring or forbidding the selected
     additional tag.  Instead of pressing `+' or `-' after `/', you can
     also immediately use the `\' command.

     In order to filter for effort estimates, you should set-up allowed
     efforts globally, for example
          (setq org-global-properties
              '(("Effort_ALL". "0 0:10 0:30 1:00 2:00 3:00 4:00")))
     You can then filter for an effort by first typing an operator, one
     of `<', `>', and `=', and then the one-digit index of an effort
     estimate in your array of allowed values, where `0' means the 10th
     value.  The filter will then restrict to entries with effort
     smaller-or-equal, equal, or larger-or-equal than the selected
     value.  If the digits 0-9 are not used as fast access keys to
     tags, you can also simply press the index digit directly without
     an operator.  In this case, `<' will be assumed.  For application
     of the operator, entries without a defined effort will be treated
     according to the value of `org-sort-agenda-noeffort-is-high'.  To
     filter for tasks without effort definition, press `?' as the
     operator.

     Org also supports automatic, context-aware tag filtering.  If the
     variable `org-agenda-auto-exclude-function' is set to a
     user-defined function, that function can decide which tags should
     be excluded from the agenda automatically.  Once this is set, the
     `/' command then accepts `RET' as a sub-option key and runs the
     auto exclusion logic.  For example, let's say you use a `Net' tag
     to identify tasks which need network access, an `Errand' tag for
     errands in town, and a `Call' tag for making phone calls.  You
     could auto-exclude these tags based on the availability of the
     Internet, and outside of business hours, with something like this:

          (defun org-my-auto-exclude-function (tag)
            (and (cond
          	((string= tag "Net")
          	 (/= 0 (call-process "/sbin/ping" nil nil nil
          			     "-c1" "-q" "-t1" "mail.gnu.org")))
          	((or (string= tag "Errand") (string= tag "Call"))
          	 (let ((hour (nth 2 (decode-time))))
          	   (or (< hour 8) (> hour 21)))))
                 (concat "-" tag)))

          (setq org-agenda-auto-exclude-function 'org-my-auto-exclude-function)

`\'
     Narrow the current agenda filter by an additional condition.  When
     called with prefix arg, remove the entries that _do_ have the tag,
     or that do match the effort criterion.  You can achieve the same
     effect by pressing `+' or `-' as the first key after the `/'
     command.

`[ ] { }'

    in search view
          add new search words (`[' and `]') or new regular expressions
          (`{' and `}') to the query string.  The opening bracket/brace
          will add a positive search term prefixed by `+', indicating
          that this search term must occur/match in the entry.  The
          closing bracket/brace will add a negative search term which
          must not occur/match in the entry for it to be selected.

Remote editing
..............

`0-9'
     Digit argument.  

`C-_'
     Undo a change due to a remote editing command.  The change is
     undone both in the agenda buffer and in the remote buffer.  

`t'
     Change the TODO state of the item, both in the agenda and in the
     original org file.  

`C-S-<right>/<left>'
     Switch to the next/previous set of TODO keywords.  

`C-k'
     Delete the current agenda item along with the entire subtree
     belonging to it in the original Org file.  If the text to be
     deleted remotely is longer than one line, the kill needs to be
     confirmed by the user.  See variable `org-agenda-confirm-kill'.  

`C-c C-w'
     Refile the entry at point.  

`C-c C-x C-a  or short  a'
     Archive the subtree corresponding to the entry at point using the
     default archiving command set in `org-archive-default-command'.
     When using the `a' key, confirmation will be required.  

`C-c C-x a'
     Toggle the ARCHIVE tag for the current headline.  

`C-c C-x A'
     Move the subtree corresponding to the current entry to its _archive
     sibling_.  

`C-c C-x C-s  or short  $'
     Archive the subtree corresponding to the current headline.  This
     means the entry will be moved to the configured archive location,
     most likely a different file.  

`T'
     Show all tags associated with the current item.  This is useful if
     you have turned off `org-agenda-show-inherited-tags', but still
     want to see all tags of a headline occasionally.  

`:'
     Set tags for the current headline.  If there is an active region
     in the agenda, change a tag for all headings in the region.  

`,'
     Set the priority for the current item.  Org mode prompts for the
     priority character. If you reply with <SPC>, the priority cookie
     is removed from the entry.  

`P'
     Display weighted priority of current item.  

`+'
`S-<up>'
     Increase the priority of the current item.  The priority is
     changed in the original buffer, but the agenda is not resorted.
     Use the `r' key for this.  

`-'
`S-<down>'
     Decrease the priority of the current item.  

`z'
     Add a note to the entry.  This note will be recorded, and then
     files to the same location where state change notes are put.
     Depending on `org-log-into-drawer', this maybe inside a drawer.  

`C-c C-a'
     Dispatcher for all command related to attachments.  

`C-c C-s'
     Schedule this item 

`C-c C-d'
     Set a deadline for this item.  

`k'
     Agenda actions, to set dates for selected items to the cursor date.
     This command also works in the calendar!  The command prompts for
     an additional key:
          m   Mark the entry at point for action.  You can also make entries
              in Org files with `C-c C-x C-k'.
          d   Set the deadline of the marked entry to the date at point.
          s   Schedule the marked entry at the date at point.
          r   Call `org-remember' with the cursor date as default date.
     Press `r' afterward to refresh the agenda and see the effect of the
     command.  

`S-<right>'
     Change the timestamp associated with the current line by one day
     into the future.  With a numeric prefix argument, change it by
     that many days.  For example, `3 6 5 S-<right>' will change it by
     a year.  With a `C-u' prefix, change the time by one hour.  If you
     immediately repeat the command, it will continue to change hours
     even without the prefix arg.  With a double `C-u C-u' prefix, do
     the same for changing minutes.  The stamp is changed in the
     original Org file, but the change is not directly reflected in the
     agenda buffer.  Use `r' or `g' to update the buffer.  

`S-<left>'
     Change the timestamp associated with the current line by one day
     into the past.  

`>'
     Change the timestamp associated with the current line to today.
     The key `>' has been chosen, because it is the same as `S-.' on my
     keyboard.  

`I'
     Start the clock on the current item.  If a clock is running
     already, it is stopped first.  

`O'
     Stop the previously started clock.  

`X'
     Cancel the currently running clock.

`J'
     Jump to the running clock in another window.

Bulk remote editing selected entries
....................................

`s'
     Mark the entry at point for bulk action.

`u'
     Unmark entry for bulk action.

`U'
     Unmark all marked entries for bulk action.

`B'
     Bulk action: act on all marked entries in the agenda.  This will
     prompt for another key to select the action to be applied:
          r  Prompt for a single refile target and move all entries.  The entries
             will no longer be in the agenda, refresh (`g') to bring them back.
          $  Archive all selected entries.
          A  Archive entries by moving them to their respective archive siblings.
          t  Change TODO state.  This prompts for a single TODO keyword and
             changes the state of all selected entries, bypassing blocking and
             suppressing logging notes (but not time stamps).
          +  Add a tag to all selected entries.
          -  Remove a tag from all selected entries.
          s  Schedule all items to a new date.  To shift existing schedule dates
             by a fixed number of days, use something starting with double plus
             at the prompt, for example `++8d' or `++2w'.
          d  Set deadline to a specific date.

Calendar commands
.................

`c'
     Open the Emacs calendar and move to the date at the agenda cursor.

`c'
     When in the calendar, compute and show the Org mode agenda for the
     date at the cursor.  

`i'
     Insert a new entry into the diary, using the date at the cursor
     and (for block entries) the date at the mark.  This will add to
     the Emacs diary file(2), in a way similar to the `i' command in
     the calendar.  The diary file will pop up in another window, where
     you can add the entry.

     If you configure `org-agenda-diary-file' to point to an Org-mode
     file, Org will create entries (in org-mode syntax) in that file
     instead.  Most entries will be stored in a date-based outline tree
     that will later make it easy to archive appointments from previous
     months/years.  The tree will be build under an entry with a
     `DATE_TREE' property, or else with years as top-level entries.
     Emacs will prompt you for the entry text - if you specify it, the
     entry will be created in `org-agenda-diary-file' without further
     interaction.  If you directly press <RET> at the prompt without
     typing text, the target file will be shown in another window for
     you to finish the entry there.  See also the `k r' command.  

`M'
     Show the phases of the moon for the three months around current
     date.  

`S'
     Show sunrise and sunset times.  The geographical location must be
     set with calendar variables, see the documentation for the Emacs
     calendar.  

`C'
     Convert the date at cursor into many other cultural and historic
     calendars.  

`H'
     Show holidays for three months around the cursor date.

`M-x org-export-icalendar-combine-agenda-files'
     Export a single iCalendar file containing entries from all agenda
     files.  This is a globally available command, and also available
     in the agenda menu.

Exporting to a file
...................

`C-x C-w'
     Write the agenda view to a file.  Depending on the extension of
     the selected file name, the view will be exported as HTML
     (extension `.html' or `.htm'), Postscript (extension `.ps'), PDF
     (extension `.pdf'), and plain text (any other extension).  When
     called with a `C-u' prefix argument, immediately open the newly
     created file.  Use the variable `org-agenda-exporter-settings' to
     set options for `ps-print' and for `htmlize' to be used during
     export.

Quit and Exit
.............

`q'
     Quit agenda, remove the agenda buffer.  

`x'
     Exit agenda, remove the agenda buffer and all buffers loaded by
     Emacs for the compilation of the agenda.  Buffers created by the
     user to visit Org files will not be removed.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Custom commands can preset a filter by binding the variable
`org-agenda-filter-preset' as an option.  This filter will then be
applied to the view and persist as a basic filter through refreshes and
more secondary filtering.

   (2) This file is parsed for the agenda when
`org-agenda-include-diary' is set.

10.6 Custom agenda views
========================

Custom agenda commands serve two purposes: to store and quickly access
frequently used TODO and tags searches, and to create special composite
agenda buffers.  Custom agenda commands will be accessible through the
dispatcher (*note Agenda dispatcher::), just like the default commands.

* Menu:

* Storing searches::            Type once, use often
* Block agenda::                All the stuff you need in a single buffer
* Setting Options::             Changing the rules


File: org,  Node: Storing searches,  Next: Block agenda,  Prev: Custom agenda views,  Up: Custom agenda views

10.6.1 Storing searches
-----------------------

The first application of custom searches is the definition of keyboard
shortcuts for frequently used searches, either creating an agenda
buffer, or a sparse tree (the latter covering of course only the current
buffer).  Custom commands are configured in the variable
`org-agenda-custom-commands'.  You can customize this variable, for
example by pressing `C-c a C'.  You can also directly set it with Emacs
Lisp in `.emacs'.  The following example contains all valid search
types:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("w" todo "WAITING")
             ("W" todo-tree "WAITING")
             ("u" tags "+boss-urgent")
             ("v" tags-todo "+boss-urgent")
             ("U" tags-tree "+boss-urgent")
             ("f" occur-tree "\\<FIXME\\>")
             ("h" . "HOME+Name tags searches") ; description for "h" prefix
             ("hl" tags "+home+Lisa")
             ("hp" tags "+home+Peter")
             ("hk" tags "+home+Kim")))

The initial string in each entry defines the keys you have to press
after the dispatcher command `C-c a' in order to access the command.
Usually this will be just a single character, but if you have many
similar commands, you can also define two-letter combinations where the
first character is the same in several combinations and serves as a
prefix key(1).  The second parameter is the search type, followed by
the string or regular expression to be used for the matching.  The
example above will therefore define:

`C-c a w'
     as a global search for TODO entries with `WAITING' as the TODO
     keyword

`C-c a W'
     as the same search, but only in the current buffer and displaying
     the results as a sparse tree

`C-c a u'
     as a global tags search for headlines marked `:boss:' but not
     `:urgent:'

`C-c a v'
     as the same search as `C-c a u', but limiting the search to
     headlines that are also TODO items

`C-c a U'
     as the same search as `C-c a u', but only in the current buffer and
     displaying the result as a sparse tree

`C-c a f'
     to create a sparse tree (again: current buffer only) with all
     entries containing the word `FIXME'

`C-c a h'
     as a prefix command for a HOME tags search where you have to press
     an additional key (`l', `p' or `k') to select a name (Lisa, Peter,
     or Kim) as additional tag to match.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) You can provide a description for a prefix key by inserting a
cons cell with the prefix and the description.


File: org,  Node: Block agenda,  Next: Setting Options,  Prev: Storing searches,  Up: Custom agenda views

10.6.2 Block agenda
-------------------

Another possibility is the construction of agenda views that comprise
the results of _several_ commands, each of which creates a block in the
agenda buffer.  The available commands include `agenda' for the daily
or weekly agenda (as created with `C-c a a'), `alltodo' for the global
TODO list (as constructed with `C-c a t'), and the matching commands
discussed above: `todo', `tags', and `tags-todo'.  Here are two
examples:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("h" "Agenda and Home-related tasks"
              ((agenda "")
               (tags-todo "home")

This will define `C-c a h' to create a multi-block view for stuff you
need to attend to at home.  The resulting agenda buffer will contain
your agenda for the current week, all TODO items that carry the tag
`home', and also all lines tagged with `garden'.  Finally the command
`C-c a o' provides a similar view for office tasks.
