There is a install issue about when I install the edison board in arduino IDE.It reported 
"
find: invalid mode ‘+111’
"
and I install failed . 
the enviroment is :
arduino-1.6.5-r5
and I resolve the issue 
In File : 
    ~/.arduino15/packages/Intel/tools/i586-poky-linux-uclibc/1.6.2+1.0/i586/install_script.sh
    Find the line : 
        executable_files="'"$($SUDO_EXEC find "$native_sysroot" -type f -perm +111)"'"
        executable_files=$($SUDO_EXEC find "$native_sysroot" -type f -perm +111 -exec printf "\"%s\" " {} \; )
    replace it with : 
        executable_files=$($SUDO_EXEC find "$native_sysroot" -type f -perm /111 -exec printf "\"%s\" " {} \; )
    also , you can commit the line in that file which cause the issue.
