bdwgc - 7.4.2-r0 - A garbage collector for C and C++  The Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative
 garbage collector can be used as a   garbage collecting replacement for C
 malloc or C++ new. It allows you to   allocate memory basically as you
 normally would, without explicitly   deallocating memory that is no
 longer useful. The collector automatically   recycles memory when it
 determines that it can no longer be otherwise   accessed.  The collector
 is also used by a number of programming language   implementations that
 either use C as intermediate code, want to   facilitate easier
 interoperation with C libraries, or just prefer the   simple collector
 interface.  Alternatively, the garbage collector may be   used as a leak
 detector for C or C++ programs, though that is not its   primary goal.
 Empirically, this collector works with most unmodified C   programs,
 simply by replacing malloc with GC_malloc calls, replacing   realloc with
 GC_realloc calls, and removing free calls.

 (Static Libraries)  Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that
 converts an annotated   context-free grammar into an LALR(1) or GLR
 parser for that grammar.   Bison is upward compatible with Yacc: all
 properly-written Yacc grammars   ought to work with Bison with no change.
 Anyone familiar with Yacc should   be able to use Bison with little
 trouble.  This package contains static   libraries for software
 development.

 installing gems, it checks the versions of every gem to make sure that
 they are compatible, and can all be loaded at the same time. After the
 gems have been installed, Bundler can help you update some or all of them
 when new versions become available. Finally, it records the exact
 versions that have been installed, so that others can install the exact

libclass-isa-perl - 0.36-r0 - Perl module for reporting the search path for a class's ISA tree  Suppose

 Food::Fish,Life::Fungus, and Chemicals), and some of those   superclasses
 may themselves each bederived, via its @ISA, from one or   more
 superclasses (as above).When, then, you call a method in that class
 ($fishstick->calories), Perl first searchesthere for that method, but if
 it's not there, it goes searching in its superclasses, andso on, in a
 depth-first (or maybe "height-first" is the word) search. In the above
 example,it'd first look in Food::Fish, then Food, then Matter, then
 Life::Fungus, then Life, thenChemicals.This library, Class::ISA, provides
 functions that return that list -- the list(in order) of names of classes
 Perl would search to find a method, with no duplicates.

libevtlog0 - 0.2.13-r0 - Replacement syslog API  The EventLog library aims to be a replacement of
 the               simple   syslog() API provided on UNIX systems. The
 major difference   between EventLog and syslog is that
 EventLog tries to add   structure to messages. EventLog
 provides an interface to   build, format and output an
 event record. The exact format   and output method can               be
 customized by the administrator   via a configuration               file.

libfile-checktree-perl - 4.41-r0 - Perl module that run many filetest checks on a tree  The validate()
 routine takes a single multiline string consisting of   directives, each
 containing a filename plus a file test to try on it.   (The file test may
 also be a "cd", causing subsequent relative filenames   to be interpreted
 relative to that directory.) After the file test you   may put || die to
 make it a fatal error if the file test fails. The   default is || warn.
 The file test may optionally have a "!' prepended to   test for the
 opposite condition. If you do a cd and then list some   relative
 filenames, you may want to indent them slightly for readability.   If you
 supply your own die() or warn() message, you can use $file to
 interpolate the filename. Filetests may be bunched: "-rwx" tests for all
 of -r, -w, and -x. Only the first failed test of the bunch will produce a
 warning. The routine returns the number of warnings issued.

libpgtypes-dbg - 9.2.4-r0.0 - PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source relational database system.
 PostgreSQL is an advanced Object-Relational database management system
 (DBMS) that supports almost all SQL constructs (including   transactions,
 subselects and user-defined types and functions). The   postgresql
 package includes the client programs and libraries that   you'll need to
 access a PostgreSQL DBMS server.  These PostgreSQL   client programs are
 programs that directly manipulate the internal   structure of PostgreSQL

libpq-dbg - 9.2.4-r0.0 - PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source relational database system.
 PostgreSQL is an advanced Object-Relational database management system
 (DBMS) that supports almost all SQL constructs (including   transactions,
 subselects and user-defined types and functions). The   postgresql
 package includes the client programs and libraries that   you'll need to
 access a PostgreSQL DBMS server.  These PostgreSQL   client programs are
 programs that directly manipulate the internal   structure of PostgreSQL
 databases on a PostgreSQL server. These client   programs can be located
 on the same machine with the PostgreSQL   server, or may be on a remote
 machine which accesses a PostgreSQL   server over a network connection.
 This package contains the docs     in   HTML for the whole package, as
 well as command-line utilities for   managing PostgreSQL databases on a
 PostgreSQL server.          If you   want to manipulate a PostgreSQL
 database on a local or remote   PostgreSQL server, you need this package.
 You also need to install   this package if you're installing the
 postgresql-server package.

python-snakefood - 1.4-r0 - Dependency graphing for Python  Generate dependency graphs from Python
 code. This dependency tracker   package has a few distinguishing
 characteristics     * It uses the AST to   parse the Python files. This
 is very reliable,       it always runs.    *   No module is loaded.
 Loading modules to figure out dependencies is   almost always problem,
 because a lot of codebases run initialization   code in the global
 namespace, which often requires additional setup.   Snakefood is
 guaranteed not to have this problem (it just runs, no   matter what).
 * It works on a set of files, i.e. you do not have to   specify a single
 script, you can select a directory (package or   else) or a set of files.
 It finds all the Python files recursively   automatically.    *
 Automatic/no configuration: your PYTHONPATH is   automatically adjusted
 to include the required package roots. It   figures out the paths that
 are required from the files/directories   given as input. You should not
 have to setup ANYTHING.    * It does   not have to automatically 'follow'
 dependencies between modules,   i.e. by default it only considers the
 files and directories you specify   on the command-line and their
 immediate dependencies. It also has an   option to automatically include
 only the dependencies within the   packages of the files you specify.
 * It follows the UNIX philosophy of   small programs that do one thing
 well:      it consists of a few simple   programs whose outputs you
 combine via       pipes. Graphing dependencies   always requires the user
 to filter and       cluster the filenames, so   this is appropriate. You
 can combine it with       your favourite tools,   grep, sed, etc.A
 problem with dependency trackers that run code is that   they are
 unreliable, due to the dynamic nature of Python (the presence of
 imports within function calls and __import__ hooks makes it almost
 impossible to always do the right thing). This script aims at being right
 99% of the time, and we think that given the trade-offs, 99% is good
 enough for 99% of the uses.
